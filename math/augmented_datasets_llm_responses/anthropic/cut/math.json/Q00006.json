  "solution": "### Problem:\n1. **Problem Statement**\nFind the remainder when the polynomial $P(x) = 6x^3-15x^2+21x-23$ is divided by the polynomial $D(x) = 3x-6$.\nHere, the dividend is $P(x) = 6x^3-15x^2+21x-23$ and the divisor is $D(x) = 3x-6$. We need to find the remainder of the division.\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\nWe can solve this problem using two methods:\nMethod 1: Polynomial Remainder Theorem\nMethod 2: Polynomial Long Division\n\nMethod 1: Polynomial Remainder Theorem\nTo use the Polynomial Remainder Theorem, we need to find the value of $x$ that makes the divisor $3x-6$ equal to zero.\nSet $3x-6 = 0$, which gives $3x = 6$, so $x = 2$.\nAccording to the Polynomial Remainder Theorem, the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $x-c$ is $P(c)$. In our case, we consider the divisor to be effectively in the form of $x-2$ since $3x-6 = 3(x-2)$.  We evaluate $P(2)$ to find the remainder.\n\nMethod 2: Polynomial Long Division\nWe perform polynomial long division to divide $6x^3-15x^2+21x-23$ by $3x-6$. The remainder will be the constant term left after the division process.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Method 1: Polynomial Remainder Theorem**\n- Set the divisor $3x-6$ to zero and solve for $x$:\n  $3x-6 = 0$\n  $3x = 6$\n  $x = 2$\n\n- Substitute $x=2$ into the polynomial $P(x) = 6x^3-15x^2+21x-23$:\n  $P(2) = 6(2)^3 - 15(2)^2 + 21(2) - 23$\n  $P(2) = 6(8) - 15(4) + 42 - 23$\n  $P(2) = 48 - 60 + 42 - 23$\n  $P(2) = (48 + 42) - (60 + 23)$\n  $P(2) = 90 - 83$\n  $P(2) = 7$\n  Thus, the remainder is $7$.\n\n**Method 2: Polynomial Long Division**\n```\n        2x^2   -x    +5\n      ___________________\n3x-6 |  6x^3  -15x^2  +21x  -23\n      -(6x^3  -12x^2)\n      ___________________\n             -3x^2   +21x\n             -(-3x^2  +6x)\n             ___________________\n                    15x  -23\n                    -(15x  -30)\n                    ___________________\n                           7\n```\n- Divide the first term of the dividend ($6x^3$) by the first term of the divisor ($3x$) to get the first term of the quotient: $6x^3 / 3x = 2x^2$.\n- Multiply the divisor ($3x-6$) by $2x^2$ to get $2x^2(3x-6) = 6x^3 - 12x^2$.\n- Subtract this from the dividend: $(6x^3-15x^2+21x-23) - (6x^3 - 12x^2) = -3x^2 + 21x - 23$.\n- Divide the first term of the new dividend ($-3x^2$) by the first term of the divisor ($3x$) to get the next term of the quotient: $-3x^2 / 3x = -x$.\n- Multiply the divisor ($3x-6$) by $-x$ to get $-x(3x-6) = -3x^2 + 6x$.\n- Subtract this from the new dividend: $(-3x^2 + 21x - 23) - (-3x^2 + 6x) = 15x - 23$.\n- Divide the first term of the new dividend ($15x$) by the first term of the divisor ($3x$) to get the next term of the quotient: $15x / 3x = 5$.\n- Multiply the divisor ($3x-6$) by $5$ to get $5(3x-6) = 15x - 30$.\n- Subtract this from the new dividend: $(15x - 23) - (15x - 30) = 7$.\n- The remainder is $7$.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\nThe remainder when $6x^3-15x^2+21x-23$ is divided by $3x-6$ is $7$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{7}$",
