  "solution": "**Problem Statement**\n\nThe ellipse is given by the equation $x^2+4y^2=4$.\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation $x^2-m(y+2)^2 = 1$, where $m$ is a constant.\nWe are given that the ellipse and the hyperbola are tangent. We need to compute the value of $m$.\n\nKey variables:\n- Ellipse equation: $x^2+4y^2=4$\n- Hyperbola equation: $x^2-m(y+2)^2 = 1$\n- Tangency condition: Ellipse and hyperbola intersect at exactly one point and have the same tangent at that point.\n- Unknown variable: $m$\n\n**Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use the condition for tangency by setting the discriminant of the quadratic equation obtained by substituting $x^2$ from the ellipse equation into the hyperbola equation to zero.\nAlternatively, we can use the condition that at the point of tangency, the slopes of the tangent lines to both curves are equal.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Method 1: Discriminant Method**\n1. Solve for $x^2$ from the ellipse equation: $x^2 = 4 - 4y^2$.\n2. Substitute this expression for $x^2$ into the hyperbola equation:\n   $(4 - 4y^2) - m(y+2)^2 = 1$\n3. Simplify the equation to obtain a quadratic equation in $y$:\n   $4 - 4y^2 - m(y^2 + 4y + 4) = 1$\n   $4 - 4y^2 - my^2 - 4my - 4m = 1$\n   $(-4-m)y^2 - 4my + (4-4m-1) = 0$\n   $(-4-m)y^2 - 4my + (3-4m) = 0$\n4. For tangency, the quadratic equation must have exactly one solution for $y$. This means the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant of a quadratic equation $ay^2+by+c=0$ is $D = b^2-4ac$. In our case, $a = -4-m$, $b = -4m$, $c = 3-4m$.\n   $D = (-4m)^2 - 4(-4-m)(3-4m) = 0$\n   $16m^2 - 4(-12 + 16m - 3m + 4m^2) = 0$\n   $16m^2 - 4(-12 + 13m + 4m^2) = 0$\n   $16m^2 + 48 - 52m - 16m^2 = 0$\n   $48 - 52m = 0$\n   $52m = 48$\n   $m = \\frac{48}{52} = \\frac{12}{13}$\n\n**Method 2: Equal Slopes Method**\n1. Find the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ for the ellipse $x^2+4y^2=4$ using implicit differentiation:\n   $2x + 8y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$\n   $\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{2x}{8y} = -\\frac{x}{4y}$\n2. Find the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ for the hyperbola $x^2-m(y+2)^2 = 1$ using implicit differentiation:\n   $2x - 2m(y+2) \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$\n   $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{2x}{2m(y+2)} = \\frac{x}{m(y+2)}$\n3. Equate the slopes:\n   $-\\frac{x}{4y} = \\frac{x}{m(y+2)}$\n   Assuming $x \\neq 0$ at the point of tangency, we can cancel $x$ from both sides:\n   $-\\frac{1}{4y} = \\frac{1}{m(y+2)}$\n   $-m(y+2) = 4y$\n   $-my - 2m = 4y$\n   $-2m = 4y + my$\n   $-2m = y(4+m)$\n   $y = -\\frac{2m}{m+4}$\n4. Substitute $y = -\\frac{2m}{m+4}$ into the ellipse equation $x^2 = 4-4y^2$:\n   $x^2 = 4 - 4(-\\frac{2m}{m+4})^2 = 4 - 4\\frac{4m^2}{(m+4)^2} = 4(1 - \\frac{4m^2}{(m+4)^2}) = 4\\frac{(m+4)^2 - 4m^2}{(m+4)^2} = 4\\frac{m^2+8m+16-4m^2}{(m+4)^2} = 4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2}$\n5. Substitute $y = -\\frac{2m}{m+4}$ and $x^2 = 4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2}$ into the hyperbola equation $x^2-m(y+2)^2 = 1$:\n   $4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2} - m(-\\frac{2m}{m+4}+2)^2 = 1$\n   $4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2} - m(\\frac{-2m+2(m+4)}{m+4})^2 = 1$\n   $4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2} - m(\\frac{8}{m+4})^2 = 1$\n   $4(-3m^2+8m+16) - 64m = (m+4)^2$\n   $-12m^2+32m+64 - 64m = m^2+8m+16$\n   $0 = 13m^2 + 40m - 48$\n   $m = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{40^2 - 4(13)(-48)}}{26} = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{1600 + 2496}}{26} = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{4096}}{26} = \\frac{-40 \\pm 64}{26}$\n   $m = \\frac{24}{26} = \\frac{12}{13}$ or $m = \\frac{-104}{26} = -4$. Since $m$ is likely to be positive for a hyperbola of this form, we take $m = \\frac{12}{13}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result $m = \\frac{12}{13}$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{12}{13}}$",
