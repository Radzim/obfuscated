  "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nGiven the numbers $36$, $300$, and $596$, we need to find an integer $k$ such that when $k$ is added to each of these numbers, the results are the squares of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series. We need to determine the value of $k$.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- $k$: integer to be found\n- $36, 300, 596$: given numbers\n- Arithmetic series: three consecutive terms\n- Squares: of the terms in the arithmetic series\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nLet the three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series be $a-d$, $a$, and $a+d$, where $a$ is the middle term and $d$ is the common difference. Their squares are $(a-d)^2$, $a^2$, and $(a+d)^2$.\nAccording to the problem statement, we have the following equations:\n1. $36 + k = (a-d)^2$\n2. $300 + k = a^2$\n3. $596 + k = (a+d)^2$\n\nWe can eliminate $k$ by subtracting the first equation from the second and the second equation from the third. This will give us two equations in terms of $a$ and $d$, which we can solve to find $a$ and $d$. Once we have $a$, we can substitute it back into the second equation to find $k$.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Square of binomial: $(x \\pm y)^2 = x^2 \\pm 2xy + y^2$\n- Arithmetic series definition: consecutive terms with a constant difference\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n$(300 + k) - (36 + k) = a^2 - (a-d)^2$\n$300 - 36 = a^2 - (a^2 - 2ad + d^2)$\n$264 = a^2 - a^2 + 2ad - d^2$\n$264 = 2ad - d^2$  (Equation 4)\n\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n$(596 + k) - (300 + k) = (a+d)^2 - a^2$\n$596 - 300 = (a^2 + 2ad + d^2) - a^2$\n$296 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2 - a^2$\n$296 = 2ad + d^2$  (Equation 5)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations in terms of $ad$ and $d^2$:\n$2ad - d^2 = 264$  (Equation 4)\n$2ad + d^2 = 296$  (Equation 5)\n\nAdd Equation 4 and Equation 5:\n$(2ad - d^2) + (2ad + d^2) = 264 + 296$\n$4ad = 560$\n$ad = \\frac{560}{4}$\n$ad = 140$  (Equation 6)\n\nSubtract Equation 4 from Equation 5:\n$(2ad + d^2) - (2ad - d^2) = 296 - 264$\n$2d^2 = 32$\n$d^2 = \\frac{32}{2}$\n$d^2 = 16$\n$d = \\pm \\sqrt{16}$\n$d = \\pm 4$\n\nWe can choose $d = 4$ (or $d = -4$, which would lead to the same result for $k$).\nSubstitute $d = 4$ into Equation 6:\n$a(4) = 140$\n$a = \\frac{140}{4}$\n$a = 35$\n\nNow substitute $a = 35$ into Equation 2:\n$300 + k = a^2$\n$300 + k = 35^2$\n$300 + k = 1225$\n$k = 1225 - 300$\n$k = 925$\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{925}$\n\nVerification:\nIf $k = 925$, then:\n$36 + k = 36 + 925 = 961 = 31^2$\n$300 + k = 300 + 925 = 1225 = 35^2$\n$596 + k = 596 + 925 = 1521 = 39^2$\nThe numbers $31, 35, 39$ form an arithmetic series with a common difference of $4$. Thus, the conditions are satisfied.",
