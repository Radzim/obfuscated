Problem Statement**\n\nCompute the square root of the expression formed by the product of four consecutive integers starting from 28, plus one.\nIn mathematical terms, evaluate $\\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1}$.\n\nKey variables:\n- We are asked to compute the square root of an expression.\n- The expression is formed by the product of four consecutive integers: 28, 29, 30, and 31, plus 1.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will try to find a pattern by considering similar expressions with smaller consecutive integers. We hypothesize that the expression inside the square root is a perfect square. We will then generalize the pattern algebraically to derive a formula for the square root of the product of four consecutive integers plus one. Finally, we will apply this formula to the given problem.\n\nRelevant formulas/theorems:\n- Algebraic manipulation\n- Recognizing perfect square trinomials, i.e., $(a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nLet's denote the expression inside the square root as $E = (31)(30)(29)(28)+1$.\nWe can rearrange the terms to identify a pattern:\n$E = (31 \\times 28) \\times (30 \\times 29) + 1$\n$E = (30+1)(30-2) \\times (30)(30-1) + 1$\n$E = (30^2 - 2 \\times 30 + 30 - 2) \\times (30^2 - 30) + 1$\n$E = (30^2 - 30 - 2) \\times (30^2 - 30) + 1$\n\nLet $x = 30^2 - 30$. Then $E = (x-2)x + 1 = x^2 - 2x + 1$.\nWe recognize that $x^2 - 2x + 1$ is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as $(x-1)^2$.\nSo, $E = (x-1)^2 = (30^2 - 30 - 1)^2$.\nNow we substitute back $x = 30^2 - 30 = 900 - 30 = 870$.\n$E = (870 - 1)^2 = (869)^2$.\n\nTherefore, $\\sqrt{E} = \\sqrt{(869)^2} = |869|$.\nSince 869 is positive, $\\sqrt{E} = 869$.\n\nAlternatively, let's generalize for four consecutive integers $n, n+1, n+2, n+3$.\nConsider the product $P = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$.\nRearrange the terms: $P = [n(n+3)][(n+1)(n+2)] = (n^2+3n)(n^2+3n+2)$.\nLet $y = n^2+3n$. Then $P = y(y+2) = y^2+2y$.\nSo $P+1 = y^2+2y+1 = (y+1)^2 = (n^2+3n+1)^2$.\nThus, $\\sqrt{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)+1} = \\sqrt{(n^2+3n+1)^2} = |n^2+3n+1|$.\nIn our problem, the four consecutive integers are $28, 29, 30, 31$. Let $n=28$.\nThen $n^2+3n+1 = 28^2 + 3(28) + 1 = 784 + 84 + 1 = 869$.\n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n$28^2 = 784$\n$3 \\times 28 = 84$\n$784 + 84 + 1 = 869$\n\nWe can also use the middle numbers approach.\nLet the integers be $n-1, n, n+1, n+2$. Let $n=29$.\nThen the integers are $28, 29, 30, 31$.\n$(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)+1 = [n(n+1)][(n-1)(n+2)]+1 = (n^2+n)(n^2+n-2)+1$.\nLet $z = n^2+n$. Then $(z)(z-2)+1 = z^2-2z+1 = (z-1)^2 = (n^2+n-1)^2$.\nFor $n=29$, $n^2+n-1 = 29^2+29-1 = 841+29-1 = 841+28 = 869$.\n\nFinal verification:\n$869^2 = 755161$.\n$(31)(30)(29)(28)+1 = 31 \\times 30 \\times 29 \\times 28 + 1 = 930 \\times 29 \\times 28 + 1 = 26970 \\times 28 + 1 = 755160 + 1 = 755161$.\nThus, $\\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1} = \\sqrt{755161} = 869$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{869}$",

          "Alright, I have this problem:\n\n**Compute \\(\\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1}\\).**\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's inside the square root: \\((31)(30)(29)(28) + 1\\). That's a product of four consecutive integers plus one. \n\n### Step 1: Look for a Pattern or General Formula\nI recall that sometimes products of consecutive integers have special properties. Maybe I can find a pattern or a general formula.\n\nLet me consider a general case. Suppose I have four consecutive integers: \\( n, n+1, n+2, n+3 \\).\n\nThe product \\( P \\) would be:\n\\[ P = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) \\]\n\nBut \\( P \\) looks like it's related to binomial coefficients or factorials. However, I'm not sure how to simplify this directly. \n\n### Step 2: Rewrite the Product\nI recall that \\( n(n+3) \\) and \\( (n+1)(n+2) \\) can be paired:\n\\[ n(n+3) = n^2 + 3n \\]\n\\[ (n+1)(n+2) = n^2 + 3n + 2 \\]\n\nSo, the product \\( P \\) becomes:\n\\[ P = (n^2 + 3n)(n^2 + 3n + 2) \\]\n\nLet me set \\( k = n^2 + 3n \\). Then:\n\\[ P = k(k + 2) = k^2 + 2k \\]\n\nNow, the expression inside the square root is \\( P + 1 \\), so:\n\\[ P + 1 = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Take the Square Root\nThe square root of \\( P + 1 \\) is:\n\\[ \\sqrt{P + 1} = \\sqrt{(k + 1)^2} = k + 1 \\]\n\nBut \\( k = n^2 + 3n \\), so:\n\\[ \\sqrt{P + 1} = n^2 + 3n + 1 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Apply to the Specific Problem\nIn the original problem, the four consecutive integers are \\( 28, 29, 30, 31 \\). So, \\( n = 28 \\).\n\nUsing the formula we derived:\n\\[ \\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28) + 1} = 28^2 + 3 \\times 28 + 1 \\]\n\nLet's compute this step by step:\n1. \\( 28^2 = 784 \\)\n2. \\( 3 \\times 28 = 84 \\)\n3. Add them together: \\( 784 + 84 = 868 \\)\n4. Add 1: \\( 868 + 1 = 869 \\)\n\n### Verification\nTo ensure I didn't make a mistake, I can try a smaller example. Let's take \\( n = 1 \\):\n- Product \\( P = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 24 \\)\n- \\( P + 1 = 25 \\)\n- Square root: \\( \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\)\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[ n^2 + 3n + 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 \\]\n\nIt matches! So, the formula seems correct.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, for \\( n = 28 \\), the value is indeed \\( 869 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{869}\\)."

          "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The problem is to compute the square root of the expression \\((31)(30)(29)(28) + 1\\). \n\nAt first glance, it looks like a straightforward multiplication followed by addition and then taking the square root. However, multiplying these four numbers directly seems tedious, and I suspect there's a pattern or a trick here.\n\n### Looking for Patterns\n\nI recall that sometimes expressions like \\((n)(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) + 1\\) have special properties. To test this, I consider a simpler case.\n\n#### Example: n=4\nLet's take \\(n=4\\):\n\\[ (4)(3)(2)(1) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \\]\nThe square root of 25 is 5.\n\nBut 5 can be written as \\(4^2 + 4 - (4-1)(4-2) = 16 + 4 - 6 = 14\\), which doesn't match. Hmm, this doesn't seem to help.\n\n#### Example: n=5\nNow, \\(n=5\\):\n\\[ (5)(4)(3)(2) + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 \\]\nThe square root is 11.\n\nAgain, \\(5^2 + 5 - (5-1)(5-2) = 25 + 5 - 12 = 18\\), not 11.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Maybe I need a different strategy.\n\n### Rewriting the Expression\n\nThe expression inside the square root is \\((31)(30)(29)(28) + 1\\). I wonder if I can pair the terms to make it resemble a difference of squares or something similar.\n\nLet me denote:\n\\[ n = 28 \\]\n\nThen the expression becomes:\n\\[ (n+3)(n+2)(n+1)(n) + 1 \\]\n\nI recall that \\((n+3)(n) = n^2 + 3n\\) and \\((n+2)(n+1) = n^2 + 3n + 2\\). \n\nSo, the expression can be rewritten as:\n\\[ (n^2 + 3n)(n^2 + 3n + 2) + 1 \\]\n\nLet me set \\(k = n^2 + 3n\\). Then the expression becomes:\n\\[ k(k + 2) + 1 = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2 \\]\n\n### Substituting Back\n\nNow, recall that \\(k = n^2 + 3n\\). So, the expression inside the square root is:\n\\[ (k + 1)^2 = (n^2 + 3n + 1)^2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the square root of the original expression is:\n\\[ \\sqrt{(n^2 + 3n + 1)^2} = n^2 + 3n + 1 \\]\n\nBut \\(n = 28\\). So, substituting back:\n\\[ 28^2 + 3 \\times 28 + 1 = 784 + 84 + 1 = 869 \\]\n\n### Verification\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I can verify this result by computing the original expression and its square root.\n\nFirst, compute \\((31)(30)(29)(28) + 1\\):\n- Multiply 28 and 31: \\(28 \\times 31 = 868\\)\n- Multiply 29 and 30: \\(29 \\times 30 = 870\\)\n- Now, multiply these results: \\(868 \\times 870\\)\n\nBut \\(868 \\times 870 = (869 - 1)(869 + 1) = 869^2 - 1^2 = 869^2 - 1\\)\n\nThus, \\((31)(30)(29)(28) = 869^2 - 1\\), and adding 1 gives:\n\\[ (31)(30)(29)(28) + 1 = 869^2 \\]\n\nTaking the square root indeed gives:\n\\[ \\sqrt{869^2} = 869 \\]\n\n### Generalization\n\nThis seems to be a general pattern. For any integer \\(n\\), the expression \\((n)(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) + 1\\) is a perfect square. \n\nFrom the previous steps, we saw that:\n\\[ (n)(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) + 1 = (n^2 + 3n + 1)^2 \\]\n\nThis is a neat identity! It's always satisfying to find such patterns.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUsing the pattern, we've simplified the original problem and found that:\n\\[ \\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28) + 1} = 28^2 + 3 \\times 28 + 1 = 869 \\]\n\n\\boxed{869}"
