So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n        $(x^2 - 10x + 25) - 50y^2 = 0$\n        The first three terms form a perfect square: $(x - 5)^2$.\n        So the equation becomes:\n        $(x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0$\n        This equation is in the form $X^2 - Y^2 = 0$, where $X = (x - 5)$ and $Y = \\sqrt{50}y$.\n        We can factor this equation as a difference of squares:\n        $[(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y][(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y] = 0$\n        This means either $(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y = 0$ or $(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y = 0$.\n        These are the equations of two lines:\n        Line 1: $(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y = 0 \\implies \\sqrt{50}y = (x - 5) \\implies y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}}(x - 5) = \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2}}(x - 5) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}(x - 5)$\n        Line 2: $(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y = 0 \\implies -\\sqrt{50}y = (x - 5) \\implies y = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}}(x - 5) = -\\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2}}(x - 5) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}(x - 5)$\n        These are two distinct lines passing through the point $(5, 0)$ with slopes $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}$ and $-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}$.\n        Therefore, the graph of the equation is two lines.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Final Answer}\n        \\boxed{\\text{two lines}}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n```",

However, since the specific equation is not provided in your question, I'll outline the general approach to identify the conic section based on its standard form.\n\n### General Forms of Conic Sections:\n1. **Parabola**: \n   - Standard form: \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) (opens vertically) or \\( x = ay^2 + by + c \\) (opens horizontally).\n   - Characteristic: Only one of the variables (\\( x \\) or \\( y \\)) is squared.\n\n2. **Circle**: \n   - Standard form: \\( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \\).\n   - Characteristic: Both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are squared with the same coefficient.\n\n3. **Ellipse**: \n   - Standard form: \\( \\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1 \\).\n   - Characteristic: Both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are squared with different positive coefficients.\n\n4. **Hyperbola**: \n   - Standard form: \\( \\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1 \\) or \\( \\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} - \\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} = 1 \\).\n   - Characteristic: One squared term is subtracted from the other.\n\n### Steps to Identify the Conic Section:\n1. **Check if both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are squared**:\n   - If only one is squared, it's a **parabola**.\n   - If both are squared, proceed to the next step.\n\n2. **Compare the coefficients of \\( x^2 \\) and \\( y^2 \\)**:\n   - If the coefficients are equal, it's a **circle**.\n   - If the coefficients are different but both positive, it's an **ellipse**.\n   - If one coefficient is positive and the other is negative, it's a **hyperbola**.\n\n3. **Check for other forms** (e.g., rotated conics or degenerate cases).\n\n### Example:\nIf the given equation is \\( x^2 + y^2 - 4x + 6y + 9 = 0 \\), we can complete the square to identify the conic section.\n\n1.
