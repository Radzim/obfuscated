  "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\nFind all real numbers $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^4+(2-x)^4=34$.\n\nKey variables: $x$\nConstraint: $x$ must be a real number.\nEquation: $x^4+(2-x)^4=34$\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nWe will use a substitution to simplify the equation.\nLet $y = x-1$. Then $x = y+1$, and $2-x = 2-(y+1) = 1-y$.\nSubstituting these into the equation, we get $(y+1)^4 + (1-y)^4 = 34$.\nExpanding $(y+1)^4$ and $(1-y)^4$ using the binomial theorem and simplifying will lead to a simpler equation in terms of $y$. Then we solve for $y$ and then for $x$.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Binomial Theorem: $(a+b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\nLet $y = x-1$. Then $x = y+1$, and $2-x = 2-(y+1) = 1-y$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$(y+1)^4 + (1-y)^4 = 34$\n\nExpand $(y+1)^4$ using the binomial theorem:\n$(y+1)^4 = \\binom{4}{0} y^4 1^0 + \\binom{4}{1} y^3 1^1 + \\binom{4}{2} y^2 1^2 + \\binom{4}{3} y^1 1^3 + \\binom{4}{4} y^0 1^4$\n$(y+1)^4 = 1 \\cdot y^4 + 4 \\cdot y^3 + 6 \\cdot y^2 + 4 \\cdot y + 1$\n$(y+1)^4 = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 1$\n\nExpand $(1-y)^4$ using the binomial theorem:\n$(1-y)^4 = \\binom{4}{0} 1^4 (-y)^0 + \\binom{4}{1} 1^3 (-y)^1 + \\binom{4}{2} 1^2 (-y)^2 + \\binom{4}{3} 1^1 (-y)^3 + \\binom{4}{4} 1^0 (-y)^4$\n$(1-y)^4 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 4 \\cdot (-y) + 6 \\cdot (-y)^2 + 4 \\cdot (-y)^3 + 1 \\cdot (-y)^4$\n$(1-y)^4 = 1 - 4y + 6y^2 - 4y^3 + y^4$\n\nAdd $(y+1)^4$ and $(1-y)^4$:\n$(y+1)^4 + (1-y)^4 = (y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 1) + (y^4 - 4y^3 + 6y^2 - 4y + 1)$\n$(y+1)^4 + (1-y)^4 = 2y^4 + 12y^2 + 2$\n\nSubstitute this back into the equation:\n$2y^4 + 12y^2 + 2 = 34$\n$2y^4 + 12y^2 - 32 = 0$\nDivide by 2:\n$y^4 + 6y^2 - 16 = 0$\n\nLet $z = y^2$. Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in $z$:\n$z^2 + 6z - 16 = 0$\nUse the quadratic formula to solve for $z$:\n$z = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{6^2 - 4(1)(-16)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 64}}{2} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = \\frac{-6 \\pm 10}{2}$\n\nTwo possible values for $z$:\n$z_1 = \\frac{-6 + 10}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$\n$z_2 = \\frac{-6 - 10}{2} = \\frac{-16}{2} = -8$\n\nSince $z = y^2$ and $y$ is a real number, $z$ must be non-negative. Thus, $z = 2$ is the only valid solution for $z$.\n$y^2 = 2$\n$y = \\pm \\sqrt{2}$\n\nSince $x = y+1$, we have two solutions for $x$:\n$x_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{2}$\n$x_2 = 1 - \\sqrt{2}$\n\nVerify the solutions:\nFor $x = 1 + \\sqrt{2}$:\n$x^4 + (2-x)^4 = (1+\\sqrt{2})^4 + (2-(1+\\sqrt{2}))^4 = (1+\\sqrt{2})^4 + (1-\\sqrt{2})^4 = 34$ (as shown in the thought process)\n\nFor $x = 1 - \\sqrt{2}$:\n$x^4 + (2-x)^4 = (1-\\sqrt{2})^4 + (2-(1-\\sqrt{2}))^4 = (1-\\sqrt{2})^4 + (1+\\sqrt{2})^4 = 34$ (as shown in the thought process)\n\nBoth solutions are verified.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1+\\sqrt{2}, 1-\\sqrt{2}}$",

          "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to find all real solutions to the equation:\n\\[ x^4 + (2 - x)^4 = 34 \\]\n\nThis is a quartic equation because the highest power of \\( x \\) is four. Solving quartic equations can be complex, but sometimes they can be simplified or transformed into more manageable forms.\n\n### Initial Approach: Expansion\n\nMy first thought is to expand \\( (2 - x)^4 \\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[ (2 - x)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} 2^{4 - k} (-x)^k \\]\n\nBut expanding this might lead to a complicated quartic equation. Let's see:\n\\[ (2 - x)^4 = 16 - 32x + 24x^2 - 8x^3 + x^4 \\]\n\nNow, substitute back into the original equation:\n\\[ x^4 + (16 - 32x + 24x^2 - 8x^3 + x^4) = 34 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ 2x^4 - 8x^3 + 24x^2 - 32x + 16 = 34 \\]\n\nSubtract 34 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\\[ 2x^4 - 8x^3 + 24x^2 - 32x - 18 = 0 \\]\n\nDivide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:\n\\[ x^4 - 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 16x - 9 = 0 \\]\n\n### Attempting to Factor the Quartic\n\nNow, I need to factor \\( x^4 - 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 16x - 9 \\). Factoring quartics can be tricky, but sometimes they can be written as products of quadratics.\n\nAssume the quartic can be written as:\n\\[ (x^2 + a x + b)(x^2 + c x + d) = 0 \\]\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\\[ x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd = 0 \\]\n\nComparing coefficients with the simplified quartic:\n1. \\( a + c = -4 \\) (coefficient of \\( x^3 \\))\n2. \\( ac + b + d = 12 \\) (coefficient of \\( x^2 \\))\n3. \\( ad + bc = -16 \\) (coefficient of \\( x \\))\n4. \\( bd = -9 \\) (constant term)\n\nNow, I need to find integers \\( b \\) and \\( d \\) such that \\( bd = -9 \\). Possible pairs \\((b, d)\\) are:\n- (1, -9), (-1, 9), (3, -3), (9, -1), (-9, 1)\n\nLet's try \\( (b, d) = (1, -9) \\):\n- From \\( a + c = -4 \\) and \\( ac + 1 - 9 = 12 \\) \u2192 \\( ac = 20 \\)\n- So, \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are roots of \\( t^2 + 4t + 20 = 0 \\). But the discriminant is \\( 16 - 80 = -64 < 0 \\). No real solutions here.\n\nNext, try \\( (b, d) = (-1, 9) \\):\n- \\( ac -1 + 9 = 12 \\) \u2192 \\( ac = 4 \\)\n- \\( a + c = -4 \\)\n- Roots of \\( t^2 + 4t + 4 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( (t + 2)^2 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( a = c = -2 \\)\n- Now, check the third equation: \\( ad + bc = a(d + b) = -2(9 -1) = -16 \\), which matches.\n\nThus, the quartic can be factored as:\n\\[ (x^2 - 2x - 1)(x^2 - 2x + 9) = 0 \\]\n\n### Solving the Quadratic Factors\n\nNow, set each quadratic factor to zero and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n1. First quadratic: \\( x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \\)\n   - Use the quadratic formula:\n     \\[ x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{8}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\]\n\n2. Second quadratic: \\( x^2 - 2x + 9 = 0 \\)\n   - Discriminant: \\( D = 4 - 36 = -32 < 0 \\)\n   - No real solutions here.\n\n### Verification of Solutions\n\nThe only real solutions come from the first quadratic:\n\\[ x = 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 1 - \\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nLet's verify these solutions in the original equation.\n\n**First solution: \\( x = 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\)**\n\\[ (2 - x) = 1 - \\sqrt{2} \\]\nNow, \\( x^4 + (2 - x)^4 \\):\nFirst, compute \\( x^2 = (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2 = 1 + 2\\sqrt{2} + 2 = 3 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\)\nThen, \\( x^4 = (3 + 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 + 12\\sqrt{2} + 8 = 17 + 12\\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( (2 - x)^2 = (1 - \\sqrt{2})^2 = 1 - 2\\sqrt{2} + 2 = 3 - 2\\sqrt{2} \\)\nThen, \\( (2 - x)^4 = (3 - 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 - 12\\sqrt{2} + 8 = 17 - 12\\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nNow, add them:\n\\[ x^4 + (2 - x)^4 = (17 + 12\\sqrt{2}) + (17 - 12\\sqrt{2}) = 34 \\]\n\n**Second solution: \\( x = 1 - \\sqrt{2} \\)**\nThis is similar to the first case, but with \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) replaced by \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\). The calculations will be identical, and the result will again be 34.\n\n### Alternative Approach: Substitution\n\nLooking for a simpler approach, perhaps a substitution can help. Let's consider the symmetry of the equation.\n\nLet \\( y = x - 1 \\). This centers the equation around \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nThen, \\( x = y + 1 \\), and \\( (2 - x) = 1 - y \\).\n\nSubstitute into the original equation:\n\\[ (y + 1)^4 + (1 - y)^4 = 34 \\]\n\nNow, expand both terms:\n\\[ (y + 1)^4 = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 1 \\]\n\\[ (1 - y)^4 = y^4 - 4y^3 + 6y^2 - 4y + 1 \\]\n\nAdd them together:\n\\[ 2y^4 + 12y^2 + 2 = 34 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[ 2y^4 + 12y^2 - 32 = 0 \\]\n\\[ y^4 + 6y^2 - 16 = 0 \\]\n\nLet \\( z = y^2 \\):\n\\[ z^2 + 6z - 16 = 0 \\]\n\nSolve the quadratic in \\( z \\):\n\\[ z = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 64}}{2} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = \\frac{-6 \\pm 10}{2} \\]\n\nThus:\n1. \\( z = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\)\n2. \\( z = \\frac{-16}{2} = -8 \\)\n\nSince \\( z = y^2 \\), and \\( y^2 \\) must be non-negative, we discard \\( z = -8 \\).\n\nThus:\n\\[ y^2 = 2 \\]\n\\[ y = \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nRecall that \\( x = y + 1 \\), so:\n1. \\( x = 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\)\n2. \\( x = 1 - \\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nThis matches our previous solutions and is much simpler!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only real solutions to the equation \\( x^4 + (2 - x)^4 = 34 \\) are \\( x = 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( x = 1 - \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{1 + \\sqrt{2}}\\) and \\(\\boxed{1 - \\sqrt{2}}\\)."
