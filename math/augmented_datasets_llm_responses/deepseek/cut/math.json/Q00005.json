  "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nGiven the numbers $36$, $300$, and $596$, we need to find an integer $k$ such that when $k$ is added to each of these numbers, the results are the squares of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series. We need to determine the value of $k$.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- $k$: integer to be found\n- $36, 300, 596$: given numbers\n- Arithmetic series: three consecutive terms\n- Squares: of the terms in the arithmetic series\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nLet the three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series be $a-d$, $a$, and $a+d$, where $a$ is the middle term and $d$ is the common difference. Their squares are $(a-d)^2$, $a^2$, and $(a+d)^2$.\nAccording to the problem statement, we have the following equations:\n1. $36 + k = (a-d)^2$\n2. $300 + k = a^2$\n3. $596 + k = (a+d)^2$\n\nWe can eliminate $k$ by subtracting the first equation from the second and the second equation from the third. This will give us two equations in terms of $a$ and $d$, which we can solve to find $a$ and $d$. Once we have $a$, we can substitute it back into the second equation to find $k$.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Square of binomial: $(x \\pm y)^2 = x^2 \\pm 2xy + y^2$\n- Arithmetic series definition: consecutive terms with a constant difference\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n$(300 + k) - (36 + k) = a^2 - (a-d)^2$\n$300 - 36 = a^2 - (a^2 - 2ad + d^2)$\n$264 = a^2 - a^2 + 2ad - d^2$\n$264 = 2ad - d^2$  (Equation 4)\n\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n$(596 + k) - (300 + k) = (a+d)^2 - a^2$\n$596 - 300 = (a^2 + 2ad + d^2) - a^2$\n$296 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2 - a^2$\n$296 = 2ad + d^2$  (Equation 5)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations in terms of $ad$ and $d^2$:\n$2ad - d^2 = 264$  (Equation 4)\n$2ad + d^2 = 296$  (Equation 5)\n\nAdd Equation 4 and Equation 5:\n$(2ad - d^2) + (2ad + d^2) = 264 + 296$\n$4ad = 560$\n$ad = \\frac{560}{4}$\n$ad = 140$  (Equation 6)\n\nSubtract Equation 4 from Equation 5:\n$(2ad + d^2) - (2ad - d^2) = 296 - 264$\n$2d^2 = 32$\n$d^2 = \\frac{32}{2}$\n$d^2 = 16$\n$d = \\pm \\sqrt{16}$\n$d = \\pm 4$\n\nWe can choose $d = 4$ (or $d = -4$, which would lead to the same result for $k$).\nSubstitute $d = 4$ into Equation 6:\n$a(4) = 140$\n$a = \\frac{140}{4}$\n$a = 35$\n\nNow substitute $a = 35$ into Equation 2:\n$300 + k = a^2$\n$300 + k = 35^2$\n$300 + k = 1225$\n$k = 1225 - 300$\n$k = 925$\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{925}$\n\nVerification:\nIf $k = 925$, then:\n$36 + k = 36 + 925 = 961 = 31^2$\n$300 + k = 300 + 925 = 1225 = 35^2$\n$596 + k = 596 + 925 = 1521 = 39^2$\nThe numbers $31, 35, 39$ form an arithmetic series with a common difference of $4$. Thus, the conditions are satisfied.",

          "Alright, I have this problem:\n\n**Problem Statement:**  \nIf the integer \\( k \\) is added to each of the numbers \\( 36 \\), \\( 300 \\), and \\( 596 \\), one obtains the squares of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series. Find \\( k \\).\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have three numbers: 36, 300, and 596. We add the same integer \\( k \\) to each of them, resulting in three new numbers. These new numbers are the squares of three consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence.\n\n### Breaking It Down\n1. **Arithmetic Sequence**: An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's say the three consecutive terms are \\( a - d \\), \\( a \\), and \\( a + d \\), where \\( a \\) is the middle term and \\( d \\) is the common difference.\n\n2. **Squares of Terms**: The problem says that after adding \\( k \\) to each of the original numbers, we get the squares of these terms. So:\n   \\[ 36 + k = (a - d)^2 \\]\n   \\[ 300 + k = a^2 \\]\n   \\[ 596 + k = (a + d)^2 \\]\n\n### Approach to Solution\nI need to find \\( k \\). To do this, I need to find \\( a \\) and \\( d \\) first.\n\n### Step 1: Subtract Equations to Eliminate \\( k \\)\nSince \\( k \\) is common in all three equations, I can subtract them to eliminate \\( k \\).\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\\[ (300 + k) - (36 + k) = a^2 - (a - d)^2 \\]\n\\[ 264 = a^2 - (a^2 - 2ad + d^2) \\]\n\\[ 264 = 2ad - d^2 \\]  \nLet's call this Equation (1).\n\nSubtract the second equation from the third:\n\\[ (596 + k) - (300 + k) = (a + d)^2 - a^2 \\]\n\\[ 296 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2 - a^2 \\]\n\\[ 296 = 2ad + d^2 \\]  \nLet's call this Equation (2).\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\( d \\) and \\( a \\)\nNow, I have two equations:\n1. \\( 2ad - d^2 = 264 \\) (Equation 1)\n2. \\( 2ad + d^2 = 296 \\) (Equation 2)\n\nI can add these two equations to eliminate \\( d^2 \\):\n\\[ (2ad - d^2) + (2ad + d^2) = 264 + 296 \\]\n\\[ 4ad = 560 \\]\n\\[ ad = 140 \\]  \nNow, I have \\( ad = 140 \\).\n\nNow, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\\[ (2ad + d^2) - (2ad - d^2) = 296 - 264 \\]\n\\[ 2d^2 = 32 \\]\n\\[ d^2 = 16 \\]\n\\[ d = \\pm 4 \\]\n\nNow, I have two cases for \\( d \\).\n\n#### Case 1: \\( d = 4 \\)\nFrom \\( ad = 140 \\):\n\\[ a \\times 4 = 140 \\]\n\\[ a = 35 \\]\n\nNow, verify with Equation 1:\n\\[ 2 \\times 35 \\times 4 - (4)^2 = 280 - 16 = 264 \\] \u2714\ufe0f\n\n#### Case 2: \\( d = -4 \\)\nFrom \\( ad = 140 \\):\n\\[ a \\times (-4) = 140 \\]\n\\[ a = -35 \\]\n\nNow, verify with Equation 1:\n\\[ 2 \\times (-35) \\times (-4) - (-4)^2 = 280 - 16 = 264 \\] \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth cases are valid, but since the problem is about squares, the sign of \\( a \\) doesn't matter because \\( a^2 \\) will be the same.\n\n### Step 3: Find \\( k \\)\nNow, recall the second original equation:\n\\[ 300 + k = a^2 \\]\n\nFor both cases:\n1. \\( a = 35 \\)\n   \\[ 300 + k = 35^2 = 1225 \\]\n   \\[ k = 1225 - 300 = 925 \\]\n\n2. \\( a = -35 \\)\n   \\[ 300 + k = (-35)^2 = 1225 \\]\n   \\[ k = 1225 - 300 = 925 \\]\n\nIn both cases, \\( k \\) is the same.\n\n### Verification\nLet's verify all three numbers with \\( k = 925 \\):\n\n1. \\( 36 + 925 = 961 \\)\n   \\[ (a - d)^2 = (35 - 4)^2 = 31^2 = 961 \\] \u2714\ufe0f\n   Or \\( (-35 - (-4))^2 = (-31)^2 = 961 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. \\( 300 + 925 = 1225 \\)\n   \\[ a^2 = 35^2 = 1225 \\] \u2714\ufe0f\n   Or \\( (-35)^2 = 1225 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. \\( 596 + 925 = 1521 \\)\n   \\[ (a + d)^2 = (35 + 4)^2 = 39^2 = 1521 \\] \u2714\ufe0f\n   Or \\( (-35 + (-4))^2 = (-39)^2 = 1521 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll verifications pass, so \\( k = 925 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe integer \\( k \\) that satisfies the given condition is:\n\n\\boxed{925}"
