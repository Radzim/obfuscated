  "solution": "### Problem:\n1. **Problem Statement**\n   Determine whether the function $f(x) = 3^{x^2-3} - |x|$ is even, odd, or neither.\n   We need to classify the function based on its symmetry with respect to the y-axis (even) or the origin (odd), or neither.\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\n   To classify the function, we will evaluate $f(-x)$ and compare it with $f(x)$ and $-f(x)$.\n   - If $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain, the function is even.\n   - If $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain, the function is odd.\n   - If neither of the above conditions holds, the function is neither even nor odd.\n   The domain of $f(x) = 3^{x^2-3} - |x|$ is all real numbers, since $x^2-3$ is defined for all real numbers, $3^{x^2-3}$ is defined for all real numbers, and $|x|$ is defined for all real numbers.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n   Given the function $f(x) = 3^{x^2-3} - |x|$.\n   To determine if the function is even, odd, or neither, we need to evaluate $f(-x)$.\n   Substitute $-x$ for $x$ in the expression for $f(x)$:\n   $f(-x) = 3^{(-x)^2-3} - |-x|$\n\n   Now, simplify the expression for $f(-x)$ using the properties of exponents and absolute value:\n   $(-x)^2 = x^2$\n   $|-x| = |x|$\n\n   Substituting these simplified terms back into the expression for $f(-x)$:\n   $f(-x) = 3^{x^2-3} - |x|$\n\n   Now we compare $f(-x)$ with $f(x)$.\n   We have $f(x) = 3^{x^2-3} - |x|$ and $f(-x) = 3^{x^2-3} - |x|$.\n   We can see that $f(-x) = f(x)$.\n\n   Since $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, the function is an even function.\n   To confirm it is not odd, let's check if $f(-x) = -f(x)$.\n   $-f(x) = -(3^{x^2-3} - |x|) = -3^{x^2-3} + |x|$\n   We compare $f(-x)$ and $-f(x)$:\n   $f(-x) = 3^{x^2-3} - |x|$\n   $-f(x) = -3^{x^2-3} + |x|$\n   Clearly, $f(-x) \\neq -f(x)$ unless $|x| = 3^{x^2-3} - |x|$ which simplifies to $2|x| = 3^{x^2-3}$, which is not true for all $x$. For instance, if $x=1$, $2|1| = 2$ and $3^{1^2-3} = 3^{-2} = 1/9$. $2 \\neq 1/9$.\n\n   Therefore, the function is even.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n   The function $f(x) = 3^{x^2-3} - |x|$ is an even function.\n\n   Final Answer: \\boxed{even}",
