  "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\nFind all real numbers $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^4+(2-x)^4=34$.\n\nKey variables: $x$\nConstraint: $x$ must be a real number.\nEquation: $x^4+(2-x)^4=34$\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nWe will use a substitution to simplify the equation.\nLet $y = x-1$. Then $x = y+1$, and $2-x = 2-(y+1) = 1-y$.\nSubstituting these into the equation, we get $(y+1)^4 + (1-y)^4 = 34$.\nExpanding $(y+1)^4$ and $(1-y)^4$ using the binomial theorem and simplifying will lead to a simpler equation in terms of $y$. Then we solve for $y$ and then for $x$.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Binomial Theorem: $(a+b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\nLet $y = x-1$. Then $x = y+1$, and $2-x = 2-(y+1) = 1-y$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$(y+1)^4 + (1-y)^4 = 34$\n\nExpand $(y+1)^4$ using the binomial theorem:\n$(y+1)^4 = \\binom{4}{0} y^4 1^0 + \\binom{4}{1} y^3 1^1 + \\binom{4}{2} y^2 1^2 + \\binom{4}{3} y^1 1^3 + \\binom{4}{4} y^0 1^4$\n$(y+1)^4 = 1 \\cdot y^4 + 4 \\cdot y^3 + 6 \\cdot y^2 + 4 \\cdot y + 1$\n$(y+1)^4 = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 1$\n\nExpand $(1-y)^4$ using the binomial theorem:\n$(1-y)^4 = \\binom{4}{0} 1^4 (-y)^0 + \\binom{4}{1} 1^3 (-y)^1 + \\binom{4}{2} 1^2 (-y)^2 + \\binom{4}{3} 1^1 (-y)^3 + \\binom{4}{4} 1^0 (-y)^4$\n$(1-y)^4 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 4 \\cdot (-y) + 6 \\cdot (-y)^2 + 4 \\cdot (-y)^3 + 1 \\cdot (-y)^4$\n$(1-y)^4 = 1 - 4y + 6y^2 - 4y^3 + y^4$\n\nAdd $(y+1)^4$ and $(1-y)^4$:\n$(y+1)^4 + (1-y)^4 = (y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 1) + (y^4 - 4y^3 + 6y^2 - 4y + 1)$\n$(y+1)^4 + (1-y)^4 = 2y^4 + 12y^2 + 2$\n\nSubstitute this back into the equation:\n$2y^4 + 12y^2 + 2 = 34$\n$2y^4 + 12y^2 - 32 = 0$\nDivide by 2:\n$y^4 + 6y^2 - 16 = 0$\n\nLet $z = y^2$. Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in $z$:\n$z^2 + 6z - 16 = 0$\nUse the quadratic formula to solve for $z$:\n$z = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{6^2 - 4(1)(-16)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 64}}{2} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = \\frac{-6 \\pm 10}{2}$\n\nTwo possible values for $z$:\n$z_1 = \\frac{-6 + 10}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$\n$z_2 = \\frac{-6 - 10}{2} = \\frac{-16}{2} = -8$\n\nSince $z = y^2$ and $y$ is a real number, $z$ must be non-negative. Thus, $z = 2$ is the only valid solution for $z$.\n$y^2 = 2$\n$y = \\pm \\sqrt{2}$\n\nSince $x = y+1$, we have two solutions for $x$:\n$x_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{2}$\n$x_2 = 1 - \\sqrt{2}$\n\nVerify the solutions:\nFor $x = 1 + \\sqrt{2}$:\n$x^4 + (2-x)^4 = (1+\\sqrt{2})^4 + (2-(1+\\sqrt{2}))^4 = (1+\\sqrt{2})^4 + (1-\\sqrt{2})^4 = 34$ (as shown in the thought process)\n\nFor $x = 1 - \\sqrt{2}$:\n$x^4 + (2-x)^4 = (1-\\sqrt{2})^4 + (2-(1-\\sqrt{2}))^4 = (1-\\sqrt{2})^4 + (1+\\sqrt{2})^4 = 34$ (as shown in the thought process)\n\nBoth solutions are verified.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1+\\sqrt{2}, 1-\\sqrt{2}}$",
