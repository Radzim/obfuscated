  "solution": "## Solution:\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nWe are asked to find the remainder when the polynomial $P(x) = 2x^4+11x^3-42x^2-60x+47$ is divided by the polynomial $D(x) = x^2+7x-5$.\nLet $P(x)$ be the dividend and $D(x)$ be the divisor. We need to find the remainder $R(x)$ in the division $P(x) \\div D(x)$.\nThe degree of $P(x)$ is 4 and the degree of $D(x)$ is 2.\nThe degree of the remainder $R(x)$ must be less than the degree of the divisor $D(x)$. Thus, the degree of $R(x)$ is at most 1. We can express the remainder in the form $R(x) = ax+b$.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use polynomial long division to find the quotient and the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $D(x)$.\nThe process involves repeatedly dividing the leading term of the current dividend by the leading term of the divisor, multiplying the result by the divisor, and subtracting it from the current dividend. We continue this process until the degree of the remaining polynomial is less than the degree of the divisor.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nWe perform polynomial long division:\n```\n        2x^2  -3x   -11\n      ___________________\nx^2+7x-5 | 2x^4 +11x^3 -42x^2 -60x  +47\n        -(2x^4 +14x^3 -10x^2)\n        ___________________\n              -3x^3 -32x^2 -60x\n             -(-3x^3 -21x^2 +15x)\n             ___________________\n                    -11x^2 -75x  +47\n                   -(-11x^2 -77x  +55)\n                   ___________________\n                           2x   -8\n```\n\n**Step 1:** Divide $2x^4$ by $x^2$ to get $2x^2$. Multiply $2x^2$ by $x^2+7x-5$ to get $2x^4+14x^3-10x^2$. Subtract this from the dividend:\n$(2x^4+11x^3-42x^2-60x+47) - (2x^4+14x^3-10x^2) = -3x^3-32x^2-60x+47$.\n\n**Step 2:** Divide $-3x^3$ by $x^2$ to get $-3x$. Multiply $-3x$ by $x^2+7x-5$ to get $-3x^3-21x^2+15x$. Subtract this from the result of Step 1:\n$(-3x^3-32x^2-60x+47) - (-3x^3-21x^2+15x) = -11x^2-75x+47$.\n\n**Step 3:** Divide $-11x^2$ by $x^2$ to get $-11$. Multiply $-11$ by $x^2+7x-5$ to get $-11x^2-77x+55$. Subtract this from the result of Step 2:\n$(-11x^2-75x+47) - (-11x^2-77x+55) = 2x-8$.\n\nThe degree of $2x-8$ is 1, which is less than the degree of $x^2+7x-5$. Thus, the remainder is $R(x) = 2x-8$.\nThe quotient is $Q(x) = 2x^2-3x-11$.\n\nWe can verify this by checking if $P(x) = Q(x)D(x) + R(x)$:\n$(2x^2-3x-11)(x^2+7x-5) + (2x-8)$\n$= 2x^2(x^2+7x-5) -3x(x^2+7x-5) -11(x^2+7x-5) + (2x-8)$\n$= (2x^4+14x^3-10x^2) + (-3x^3-21x^2+15x) + (-11x^2-77x+55) + (2x-8)$\n$= 2x^4 + (14x^3-3x^3) + (-10x^2-21x^2-11x^2) + (15x-77x+2x) + (55-8)$\n$= 2x^4 + 11x^3 - 42x^2 - 60x + 47$\nThis matches the original polynomial $P(x)$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe remainder when $x^2+7x-5$ divides $2x^4+11x^3-42x^2-60x+47$ is $2x-8$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2x-8}$",
