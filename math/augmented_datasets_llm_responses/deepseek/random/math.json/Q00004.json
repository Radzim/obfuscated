  "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nFind a quadratic polynomial $P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ with real coefficients $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, such that:\n- One root of the polynomial is $3 + i$.\n- The coefficient of $x^2$ is 2, i.e., $a = 2$.\n\n**Key Variables and Constraints:**\n- Quadratic polynomial: $P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$\n- Real coefficients: $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n- Root: $r_1 = 3 + i$\n- Coefficient of $x^2$: $a = 2$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nSince the quadratic polynomial has real coefficients, if a complex number is a root, then its complex conjugate must also be a root.\nGiven that $3 + i$ is a root, the other root must be its complex conjugate, $3 - i$.\nLet the roots be $r_1 = 3 + i$ and $r_2 = 3 - i$.\nA quadratic polynomial with roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ and leading coefficient $a$ can be written as $P(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$.\nWe are given that $a = 2$. We will substitute the roots and $a$ into this form and expand to get the polynomial in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$.\n\n**Relevant Formulas/Theorems:**\n- **Complex Conjugate Root Theorem:** If a polynomial with real coefficients has a complex root $z = a + bi$, then its complex conjugate $\\bar{z} = a - bi$ is also a root.\n- **Quadratic Polynomial from Roots:** A quadratic polynomial with roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ and leading coefficient $a$ can be expressed as $P(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1:** Identify the second root using the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem.\nSince the polynomial has real coefficients and $3 + i$ is a root, its complex conjugate $3 - i$ must also be a root.\nThus, the two roots are $r_1 = 3 + i$ and $r_2 = 3 - i$.\n\n**Step 2:** Use the roots and the leading coefficient to form the quadratic polynomial.\nThe quadratic polynomial can be written as $P(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$.\nWe are given $a = 2$, $r_1 = 3 + i$, and $r_2 = 3 - i$.\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n$P(x) = 2(x - (3 + i))(x - (3 - i))$\n\n**Step 3:** Expand and simplify the expression for $P(x)$.\n$P(x) = 2((x - 3) - i)((x - 3) + i)$\nThis is in the form of $(A - B)(A + B) = A^2 - B^2$, where $A = (x - 3)$ and $B = i$.\n$P(x) = 2((x - 3)^2 - (i)^2)$\nWe know that $i^2 = -1$, so:\n$P(x) = 2((x - 3)^2 - (-1))$\n$P(x) = 2((x - 3)^2 + 1)$\nExpand $(x - 3)^2$:\n$(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 2(3)x + 3^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9$\nSubstitute this back into the expression for $P(x)$:\n$P(x) = 2((x^2 - 6x + 9) + 1)$\n$P(x) = 2(x^2 - 6x + 10)$\nDistribute the 2:\n$P(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 20$\n\n**Step 4:** Verify the conditions.\n- The coefficient of $x^2$ is 2, which is given.\n- The coefficients are $2, -12, 20$, which are all real numbers.\n- Let's check if $3 + i$ is a root of $P(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 20$.\n$P(3 + i) = 2(3 + i)^2 - 12(3 + i) + 20$\n$P(3 + i) = 2(9 + 6i + i^2) - 36 - 12i + 20$\n$P(3 + i) = 2(9 + 6i - 1) - 36 - 12i + 20$\n$P(3 + i) = 2(8 + 6i) - 36 - 12i + 20$\n$P(3 + i) = 16 + 12i - 36 - 12i + 20$\n$P(3 + i) = (16 - 36 + 20) + (12i - 12i)$\n$P(3 + i) = 0 + 0i = 0$\nSo, $3 + i$ is indeed a root.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe quadratic polynomial is $\\boxed{2x^2 - 12x + 20}$.\n\n**Verification:**\n- The polynomial is quadratic.\n- The coefficients $2, -12, 20$ are real numbers.\n- The coefficient of $x^2$ is 2.\n- $3 + i$ is a root (verified in Step 4).\n- The other root is $3 - i$. We can check this:\n$P(3 - i) = 2(3 - i)^2 - 12(3 - i) + 20$\n$P(3 - i) = 2(9 - 6i + i^2) - 36 + 12i + 20$\n$P(3 - i) = 2(9 - 6i - 1) - 36 + 12i + 20$\n$P(3 - i) = 2(8 - 6i) - 36 + 12i + 20$\n$P(3 - i) = 16 - 12i - 36 + 12i + 20$\n$P(3 - i) = (16 - 36 + 20) + (-12i + 12i)$\n$P(3 - i) = 0 + 0i = 0$\nSo, $3 - i$ is also a root. All conditions are satisfied.",
