We will substitute this into the condition and convert it into an equation in terms of $x$ and $y$.\nThen we will express $|z + i|$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ and use the condition to minimize $|z + i|$.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- For a complex number $w = a + bi$, $|w| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and $|w|^2 = a^2 + b^2 = w \\bar{w}$.\n- Properties of modulus: $|w_1 w_2| = |w_1| |w_2|$, $|w_1 / w_2| = |w_1| / |w_2|$.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Rewrite the condition:**\n   $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|$\n   Using the property $|w_1 w_2| = |w_1| |w_2|$, we have $|z(z + 2i)| = |z| |z + 2i|$.\n   So the condition is $|z^2 + 4| = |z| |z + 2i|$.\n   Square both sides to eliminate square roots:\n   $|z^2 + 4|^2 = |z|^2 |z + 2i|^2$.\n\n2. **Substitute $z = x + yi$:**\n   $z^2 + 4 = (x + yi)^2 + 4 = x^2 + 2xyi - y^2 + 4 = (x^2 - y^2 + 4) + 2xyi$.\n   $|z^2 + 4|^2 = (x^2 - y^2 + 4)^2 + (2xy)^2$.\n   $|z|^2 = x^2 + y^2$.\n   $z + 2i = x + yi + 2i = x + (y + 2)i$.\n   $|z + 2i|^2 = x^2 + (y + 2)^2$.\n   The condition becomes $(x^2 - y^2 + 4)^2 + 4x^2y^2 = (x^2 + y^2) (x^2 + (y + 2)^2)$.\n\n3. **Expand and simplify:**\n   $(x^2 - y^2 + 4)^2 + 4x^2y^2 = (x^2 + y^2) (x^2 + y^2 + 4y + 4)$\n   $(x^2 - y^2)^2 + 8(x^2 - y^2) + 16 + 4x^2y^2 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 + 4(y + 1)(x^2 + y^2)$\n   $(x^2 + y^2)^2 - 4x^2y^2 + 8(x^2 - y^2) + 16 + 4x^2y^2 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 + 4(y + 1)(x^2 + y^2)$\n   $(x^2 + y^2)^2 + 8(x^2 - y^2) + 16 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 + 4(y + 1)(x^2 + y^2)$\n   Subtract $(x^2 + y^2)^2$ from both sides:\n   $8(x^2 - y^2) + 16 = 4(y + 1)(x^2 + y^2)$\n   Divide by 4:\n   $2(x^2 - y^2) + 4 = (y + 1)(x^2 + y^2)$\n   $2x^2 - 2y^2 + 4 = x^2y + x^2 + y^3 + y^2$\n   $x^2 - x^2y - 3y^2 - y^3 + 4 = 0$\n   $x^2(1 - y) = y^3 + 3y^2 - 4$\n   $x^2(1 - y) = (y - 1)(y + 2)^2 = -(1 - y)(y + 2)^2$\n\n4. **Solve for $x^2$:**\n   If $1 - y \\neq 0$, then $x^2 = \\frac{-(1 - y)(y + 2)^2}{1 - y} = -(y + 2)^2$.\n   Since $x^2 \\ge 0$ and $-(y + 2)^2 \\le 0$, we must have $x^2 = 0$ and $-(y + 2)^2 = 0$.\n   This implies $x = 0$ and $y + 2 = 0$, so $y = -2$.\n   In this case, $z = x + yi = 0 - 2i = -2i$.\n   $|z + i| = |-2i + i| = |-i| = 1$.\n\n5. **Consider the case $1 - y = 0$, i.e., $y = 1$:**\n   If $y = 1$, the equation becomes $x^2(1 - 1) = 1^3 + 3(1)^2 - 4$, which is $0 = 1 + 3 - 4 = 0$.\n   This means when $y = 1$, the equation holds for any real $x$.\n   In this case, $z = x + i$.\n   $|z + i| = |x + i + i| = |x + 2i| = \\sqrt{x^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + 4}$.\n   To minimize $|z + i|$, we need to minimize $\\sqrt{x^2 + 4}$, which is minimized when $x = 0$.\n   When $x = 0$ and $y = 1$, $z = i$.\n   $|z + i| = |i + i| = |2i| = 2$.\n\n6. **Compare the values:**\n   We have found two possible values for $|z + i|$: $1$ (when $z = -2i$) and $2$ (when $z = i$).\n   The smallest possible value is $1$.\n\n7. **Verify the solutions:**\n   For $z = -2i$:\n   $|z^2 + 4| = |(-2i)^2 + 4| = |-4 + 4| = 0$.\n   $|z(z + 2i)| = |(-2i)(-2i + 2i)| = |(-2i)(0)| = 0$.\n   So $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|$ holds. $|z + i| = |-2i + i| = |-i| = 1$.\n\n   For $z = i$:\n   $|z^2 + 4| = |i^2 + 4| = |-1 + 4| = |3| = 3$.\n   $|z(z + 2i)| = |i(i + 2i)| = |i(3i)| = |3i^2| = |-3| = 3$.\n   So $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|$ holds. $|z + i| = |i + i| = |2i| = 2$.\n\n## Final Answer\n**1. Problem Statement**\nFind the smallest possible value of $|z + i|$ for a complex number $z$ satisfying $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|.$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\nWe simplify the equation $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|$ by substituting $z = x + yi$ and converting it into a real equation in $x$ and $y$. We then express $|z + i|$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ and minimize it under the derived constraint.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\nLet $z = x + yi$. The given condition is $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|$.\nSquaring both sides, we get $|z^2 + 4|^2 = |z|^2 |z + 2i|^2$.\nSubstituting $z = x + yi$, we have:\n$(x^2 - y^2 + 4)^2 + (2xy)^2 = (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + (y+2)^2)$.\nExpanding and simplifying this equation, we arrive at:\n$x^2(1 - y) = (y - 1)(y + 2)^2$.\nIf $y \\neq 1$, we have $x^2 = -(y + 2)^2$. Since $x^2 \\ge 0$ and $-(y+2)^2 \\le 0$, we must have $x^2 = 0$ and $-(y+2)^2 = 0$. This gives $x = 0$ and $y = -2$. Thus $z = -2i$.\nIf $y = 1$, the equation $x^2(1 - y) = (y - 1)(y + 2)^2$ becomes $0 = 0$, which holds for any $x$. In this case, $z = x + i$.\nWe want to minimize $|z + i|$.\nFor $z = -2i$, $|z + i| = |-2i + i| = |-i| = 1$.\nFor $z = x + i$, $|z + i| = |x + i + i| = |x + 2i| = \\sqrt{x^2 + 4}$. The minimum value is when $x = 0$, and the minimum value is $\\sqrt{0^2 + 4} = 2$.\nComparing the two minimum values $1$ and $2$, the smallest possible value of $|z + i|$ is $1$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",
