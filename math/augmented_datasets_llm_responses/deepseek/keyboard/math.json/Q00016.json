  "solution": "**1. Problem Statement**\n\nDetermine all possible integer roots of a polynomial equation of the form $x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x - 11 = 0$, where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are integer coefficients.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Polynomial form: $x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x - 11 = 0$\n- Coefficients $a_1, a_2$ are integers.\n- We are looking for integer roots of this polynomial.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use the Integer Root Theorem to find the possible integer roots of the given polynomial.\nThe Integer Root Theorem states that if a polynomial with integer coefficients $P(x) = c_n x^n + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + c_1 x + c_0$ has an integer root $r$, then $r$ must be a divisor of the constant term $c_0$.\n\nIn our polynomial $P(x) = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x - 11$, the coefficients are integers (1, $a_2$, $a_1$, -11), and the constant term is $c_0 = -11$.\nTherefore, any integer root of this polynomial must be a divisor of $-11$.\nWe will find all divisors of $-11$ and these will be the possible integer roots.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nStep 1: Identify the constant term of the polynomial.\nThe constant term of the polynomial $x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x - 11 = 0$ is $-11$.\n\nStep 2: Find all integer divisors of the constant term $-11$.\nWe need to find all integers that divide $-11$ without leaving a remainder.\nThe divisors of $11$ are $1, 11, -1, -11$.\nThe divisors of $-11$ are also $1, 11, -1, -11$.\nWe can list them as $\\pm 1, \\pm 11$.\nThe divisors are: $1, -1, 11, -11$.\n\nStep 3: Verify if each divisor is a possible integer root.\nFor each divisor $r$ from the set $\\{1, -1, 11, -11\\}$, we need to check if there exist integers $a_1$ and $a_2$ such that $r$ is a root of the polynomial.\nIf $r$ is a root, then $P(r) = r^3 + a_2 r^2 + a_1 r - 11 = 0$. We need to show that we can find integers $a_1, a_2$ satisfying this equation for each $r$.\n\nCase 1: $r = 1$\n$P(1) = 1^3 + a_2 (1)^2 + a_1 (1) - 11 = 1 + a_2 + a_1 - 11 = a_2 + a_1 - 10 = 0$\n$a_2 + a_1 = 10$.\nWe can choose integer values for $a_1$ and $a_2$ that satisfy this equation, e.g., $a_1 = 0, a_2 = 10$. So $x=1$ is a possible integer root.\n\nCase 2: $r = -1$\n$P(-1) = (-1)^3 + a_2 (-1)^2 + a_1 (-1) - 11 = -1 + a_2 - a_1 - 11 = a_2 - a_1 - 12 = 0$\n$a_2 - a_1 = 12$.\nWe can choose integer values for $a_1$ and $a_2$ that satisfy this equation, e.g., $a_1 = 0, a_2 = 12$. So $x=-1$ is a possible integer root.\n\nCase 3: $r = 11$\n$P(11) = (11)^3 + a_2 (11)^2 + a_1 (11) - 11 = 0$\nDivide by $11$: $11^2 + a_2 (11) + a_1 - 1 = 121 + 11a_2 + a_1 - 1 = 120 + 11a_2 + a_1 = 0$\n$11a_2 + a_1 = -120$.\nWe can choose integer values for $a_1$ and $a_2$ that satisfy this equation, e.g., $a_2 = -10, a_1 = -10$. So $x=11$ is a possible integer root.\n\nCase 4: $r = -11$\n$P(-11) = (-11)^3 + a_2 (-11)^2 + a_1 (-11) - 11 = 0$\nDivide by $-11$: $(-11)^2 - a_2 (11) - a_1 + 1 = 121 - 11a_2 - a_1 + 1 = 122 - 11a_2 - a_1 = 0$\n$11a_2 + a_1 = 122$.\nWe can choose integer values for $a_1$ and $a_2$ that satisfy this equation, e.g., $a_2 = 10, a_1 = 2$. So $x=-11$ is a possible integer root.\n\nAll divisors of $-11$ are possible integer roots.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe possible integer roots are the divisors of $-11$, which are $1, -1, 11, -11$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1, -1, 11, -11}$",
