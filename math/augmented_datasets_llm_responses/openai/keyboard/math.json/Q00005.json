  "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nGiven the numbers $36$, $300$, and $596$, we need to find an integer $k$ such that when $k$ is added to each of these numbers, the results are the squares of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series. We need to determine the value of $k$.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- $k$: integer to be found\n- $36, 300, 596$: given numbers\n- Arithmetic series: three consecutive terms\n- Squares: of the terms in the arithmetic series\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nLet the three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series be $a-d$, $a$, and $a+d$, where $a$ is the middle term and $d$ is the common difference. Their squares are $(a-d)^2$, $a^2$, and $(a+d)^2$.\nAccording to the problem statement, we have the following equations:\n1. $36 + k = (a-d)^2$\n2. $300 + k = a^2$\n3. $596 + k = (a+d)^2$\n\nWe can eliminate $k$ by subtracting the first equation from the second and the second equation from the third. This will give us two equations in terms of $a$ and $d$, which we can solve to find $a$ and $d$. Once we have $a$, we can substitute it back into the second equation to find $k$.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Square of binomial: $(x \\pm y)^2 = x^2 \\pm 2xy + y^2$\n- Arithmetic series definition: consecutive terms with a constant difference\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n$(300 + k) - (36 + k) = a^2 - (a-d)^2$\n$300 - 36 = a^2 - (a^2 - 2ad + d^2)$\n$264 = a^2 - a^2 + 2ad - d^2$\n$264 = 2ad - d^2$  (Equation 4)\n\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n$(596 + k) - (300 + k) = (a+d)^2 - a^2$\n$596 - 300 = (a^2 + 2ad + d^2) - a^2$\n$296 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2 - a^2$\n$296 = 2ad + d^2$  (Equation 5)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations in terms of $ad$ and $d^2$:\n$2ad - d^2 = 264$  (Equation 4)\n$2ad + d^2 = 296$  (Equation 5)\n\nAdd Equation 4 and Equation 5:\n$(2ad - d^2) + (2ad + d^2) = 264 + 296$\n$4ad = 560$\n$ad = \\frac{560}{4}$\n$ad = 140$  (Equation 6)\n\nSubtract Equation 4 from Equation 5:\n$(2ad + d^2) - (2ad - d^2) = 296 - 264$\n$2d^2 = 32$\n$d^2 = \\frac{32}{2}$\n$d^2 = 16$\n$d = \\pm \\sqrt{16}$\n$d = \\pm 4$\n\nWe can choose $d = 4$ (or $d = -4$, which would lead to the same result for $k$).\nSubstitute $d = 4$ into Equation 6:\n$a(4) = 140$\n$a = \\frac{140}{4}$\n$a = 35$\n\nNow substitute $a = 35$ into Equation 2:\n$300 + k = a^2$\n$300 + k = 35^2$\n$300 + k = 1225$\n$k = 1225 - 300$\n$k = 925$\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{925}$\n\nVerification:\nIf $k = 925$, then:\n$36 + k = 36 + 925 = 961 = 31^2$\n$300 + k = 300 + 925 = 1225 = 35^2$\n$596 + k = 596 + 925 = 1521 = 39^2$\nThe numbers $31, 35, 39$ form an arithmetic series with a common difference of $4$. Thus, the conditions are satisfied.",

It seems to be asking for the common difference \\( k \\) of an arithmetic sequence given the terms \\( 36 \\), \\( 300 \\), and \\( 596 \\).\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. We can find the common difference \\( k \\) by calculating the differences between the terms.\n\n1. Calculate the difference between the second term and the first term:\n   \\[\n   k_1 = 300 - 36 = 264\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the difference between the third term and the second term:\n   \\[\n   k_2 = 596 - 300 = 296\n   \\]\n\nSince \\( k_1 \\) and \\( k_2 \\) are not equal, we need to check if these terms can be part of an arithmetic sequence by finding a common difference that fits all three terms.\n\nTo find a common difference, we can set up the equations based on the assumption that the terms can be expressed as:\n- First term: \\( a \\)\n- Second term: \\( a + k \\)\n- Third term: \\( a + 2k \\)\n\nWe can set up the following equations based on the given terms:\n1. \\( a = 36 \\)\n2. \\( a + k = 300 \\)\n3. \\( a + 2k = 596 \\)\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\\[\na = 36\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( a \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n36 + k = 300 \\implies k = 300 - 36 = 264\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\( a \\) and \\( k \\) into the third equation to verify:\n\\[\n36 + 2(264) = 36 + 528 = 564 \\quad \\text{(not equal to 596)}\n\\]\n\nSince this does not hold, we need to find a consistent \\( k \\) that fits all three terms. \n\nTo find a consistent arithmetic sequence, we can calculate the average of the first and last terms:\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{36 + 596}{2} = \\frac{632}{2} = 316\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the common difference \\( k \\) by using the average:\n1. From the first term to the average:\n   \\[\n   k = 316 - 36 = 280\n   \\]\n2. From the average to the last term:\n   \\[\n   k = 596 - 316 = 280\n   \\]\n\nThus, the common difference \\( k \\) is consistent and equal to \\( 280 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{280} \\)."

It seems that the text has been scrambled, but we can extract the relevant mathematical components.\n\nThe problem states that we have three numbers: \\( 36 \\), \\( 300 \\), and \\( 596 \\). We need to find the arithmetic mean of these three numbers.\n\nThe arithmetic mean (average) is calculated by summing the numbers and then dividing by the count of the numbers.\n\n1. **Sum the numbers**:\n   \\[\n   36 + 300 + 596 = 932\n   \\]\n\n2. **Count the numbers**:\n   There are 3 numbers.\n\n3. **Calculate the arithmetic mean**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mean} = \\frac{932}{3} = 310.6667\n   \\]\n\nTo express this as a fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{932}{3} = 310 \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the arithmetic mean of the three numbers is \\( 310.6667 \\) or \\( 310 \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nFinally, we conclude the answer as requested:\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{310.6667}\\)."
