  "solution": "**Problem Statement**\n\nThe ellipse is given by the equation $x^2+4y^2=4$.\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation $x^2-m(y+2)^2 = 1$, where $m$ is a constant.\nWe are given that the ellipse and the hyperbola are tangent. We need to compute the value of $m$.\n\nKey variables:\n- Ellipse equation: $x^2+4y^2=4$\n- Hyperbola equation: $x^2-m(y+2)^2 = 1$\n- Tangency condition: Ellipse and hyperbola intersect at exactly one point and have the same tangent at that point.\n- Unknown variable: $m$\n\n**Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use the condition for tangency by setting the discriminant of the quadratic equation obtained by substituting $x^2$ from the ellipse equation into the hyperbola equation to zero.\nAlternatively, we can use the condition that at the point of tangency, the slopes of the tangent lines to both curves are equal.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Method 1: Discriminant Method**\n1. Solve for $x^2$ from the ellipse equation: $x^2 = 4 - 4y^2$.\n2. Substitute this expression for $x^2$ into the hyperbola equation:\n   $(4 - 4y^2) - m(y+2)^2 = 1$\n3. Simplify the equation to obtain a quadratic equation in $y$:\n   $4 - 4y^2 - m(y^2 + 4y + 4) = 1$\n   $4 - 4y^2 - my^2 - 4my - 4m = 1$\n   $(-4-m)y^2 - 4my + (4-4m-1) = 0$\n   $(-4-m)y^2 - 4my + (3-4m) = 0$\n4. For tangency, the quadratic equation must have exactly one solution for $y$. This means the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant of a quadratic equation $ay^2+by+c=0$ is $D = b^2-4ac$. In our case, $a = -4-m$, $b = -4m$, $c = 3-4m$.\n   $D = (-4m)^2 - 4(-4-m)(3-4m) = 0$\n   $16m^2 - 4(-12 + 16m - 3m + 4m^2) = 0$\n   $16m^2 - 4(-12 + 13m + 4m^2) = 0$\n   $16m^2 + 48 - 52m - 16m^2 = 0$\n   $48 - 52m = 0$\n   $52m = 48$\n   $m = \\frac{48}{52} = \\frac{12}{13}$\n\n**Method 2: Equal Slopes Method**\n1. Find the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ for the ellipse $x^2+4y^2=4$ using implicit differentiation:\n   $2x + 8y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$\n   $\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{2x}{8y} = -\\frac{x}{4y}$\n2. Find the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ for the hyperbola $x^2-m(y+2)^2 = 1$ using implicit differentiation:\n   $2x - 2m(y+2) \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$\n   $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{2x}{2m(y+2)} = \\frac{x}{m(y+2)}$\n3. Equate the slopes:\n   $-\\frac{x}{4y} = \\frac{x}{m(y+2)}$\n   Assuming $x \\neq 0$ at the point of tangency, we can cancel $x$ from both sides:\n   $-\\frac{1}{4y} = \\frac{1}{m(y+2)}$\n   $-m(y+2) = 4y$\n   $-my - 2m = 4y$\n   $-2m = 4y + my$\n   $-2m = y(4+m)$\n   $y = -\\frac{2m}{m+4}$\n4. Substitute $y = -\\frac{2m}{m+4}$ into the ellipse equation $x^2 = 4-4y^2$:\n   $x^2 = 4 - 4(-\\frac{2m}{m+4})^2 = 4 - 4\\frac{4m^2}{(m+4)^2} = 4(1 - \\frac{4m^2}{(m+4)^2}) = 4\\frac{(m+4)^2 - 4m^2}{(m+4)^2} = 4\\frac{m^2+8m+16-4m^2}{(m+4)^2} = 4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2}$\n5. Substitute $y = -\\frac{2m}{m+4}$ and $x^2 = 4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2}$ into the hyperbola equation $x^2-m(y+2)^2 = 1$:\n   $4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2} - m(-\\frac{2m}{m+4}+2)^2 = 1$\n   $4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2} - m(\\frac{-2m+2(m+4)}{m+4})^2 = 1$\n   $4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2} - m(\\frac{8}{m+4})^2 = 1$\n   $4(-3m^2+8m+16) - 64m = (m+4)^2$\n   $-12m^2+32m+64 - 64m = m^2+8m+16$\n   $0 = 13m^2 + 40m - 48$\n   $m = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{40^2 - 4(13)(-48)}}{26} = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{1600 + 2496}}{26} = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{4096}}{26} = \\frac{-40 \\pm 64}{26}$\n   $m = \\frac{24}{26} = \\frac{12}{13}$ or $m = \\frac{-104}{26} = -4$. Since $m$ is likely to be positive for a hyperbola of this form, we take $m = \\frac{12}{13}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result $m = \\frac{12}{13}$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{12}{13}}$",

          "To solve the problem, we start with the equations of the ellipse and the hyperbola.\n\nThe ellipse is given by:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4y^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nWe can rewrite this in standard form:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{4} + \\frac{y^2}{1} = 1\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that the semi-major axis \\( a = 2 \\) (along the x-axis) and the semi-minor axis \\( b = 1 \\) (along the y-axis).\n\nNext, we consider the hyperbola given by:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - m(y + 2)^2 = 1\n\\]\n\nWe can rewrite this in standard form as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{1} - \\frac{(y + 2)^2}{\\frac{1}{m}} = 1\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that the hyperbola opens horizontally with \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} \\).\n\nTo find the points of tangency, we need to determine the conditions under which the ellipse and hyperbola are tangent to each other. The tangency condition implies that the distance from the center of the ellipse to the center of the hyperbola must equal the sum of their respective semi-axes in the direction of tangency.\n\nThe center of the ellipse is at \\( (0, 0) \\) and the center of the hyperbola is at \\( (0, -2) \\). The distance between the centers is:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (0 - (-2))^2} = 2\n\\]\n\nThe semi-major axis of the ellipse is \\( 2 \\) and the semi-minor axis is \\( 1 \\). The semi-major axis of the hyperbola is \\( 1 \\) and the semi-minor axis is \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} \\).\n\nFor the hyperbola to be tangent to the ellipse, the distance between the centers must equal the sum of the semi-major axis of the ellipse and the semi-minor axis of the hyperbola:\n\n\\[\nd = 2 = 2 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}\n\\]\n\nRearranging this equation gives:\n\n\\[\n2 - 2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} \\implies 0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}\n\\]\n\nThis is not possible, so we need to consider the case where the hyperbola is tangent to the ellipse at the point where the ellipse is at its maximum height, which is at \\( (0, 1) \\).\n\nAt the point \\( (0, 1) \\), we substitute \\( y = 1 \\) into the hyperbola's equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - m(1 + 2)^2 = 1 \\implies x^2 - m(3^2) = 1 \\implies x^2 - 9m = 1\n\\]\n\nAt the point of tangency, \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n0 - 9m = 1 \\implies -9m = 1 \\implies m = -\\frac{1}{9}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since \\( m \\) must be positive for the hyperbola to be defined, we need to check the conditions again. \n\nThe correct approach is to find the slopes of the tangent lines at the points of tangency. The slopes of the ellipse at \\( (0, 1) \\) can be found using implicit differentiation:\n\n\\[\n2x + 8y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \\implies \\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x}{4y}\n\\]\n\nAt \\( (0, 1) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{0}{4 \\cdot 1} = 0\n\\]\n\nThe slope of the hyperbola at the point of tangency can be found similarly. The hyperbola's equation gives:\n\n\\[\n2x - 2m(y + 2) \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \\implies \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{m(y + 2)}\n\\]\n\nAt \\( (0, 1) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{0}{m(1 + 2)} = 0\n\\]\n\nBoth curves have a horizontal tangent at the point \\( (0, 1) \\). Thus, we need to ensure that the hyperbola's semi-minor axis is equal to the distance from the center of the hyperbola to the point of tangency:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}} = 1 \\implies \\sqrt{m} = 1 \\implies m = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( m \\) for which the ellipse and hyperbola are tangent is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
