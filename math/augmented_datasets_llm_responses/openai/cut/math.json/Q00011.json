  "solution": "**Problem Statement**\n\nDetermine the values of the constant $c$ for which the rational function $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x+c}{x^2+x-6}$ has exactly one vertical asymptote.\nKey variables: $c$, function $f(x)$.\nConstraint: exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n**Solution Strategy**\n\nA vertical asymptote of a rational function occurs at the values of $x$ where the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero.\nFirst, find the roots of the denominator $x^2+x-6=0$.\nThen, for the function to have exactly one vertical asymptote, the numerator $x^2-x+c$ must be zero at exactly one of these roots and non-zero at the other root.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Find the roots of the denominator:**\n   Set the denominator $x^2+x-6 = 0$.\n   Factor the quadratic equation: $(x+3)(x-2) = 0$.\n   The roots of the denominator are $x = -3$ and $x = 2$.\n   These are the potential locations of vertical asymptotes.\n\n2. **Analyze the numerator for each root of the denominator:**\n   For exactly one vertical asymptote, the numerator $x^2-x+c$ must be zero for one of $x = -3$ or $x = 2$, and non-zero for the other.\n\n   Case 1: Numerator is zero at $x = -3$ and non-zero at $x = 2$.\n   If the numerator is zero at $x = -3$, then substitute $x = -3$ into the numerator and set it to zero:\n   $(-3)^2 - (-3) + c = 0$\n   $9 + 3 + c = 0$\n   $12 + c = 0$\n   $c = -12$\n   Now check if the numerator is non-zero at $x = 2$ when $c = -12$:\n   $(2)^2 - (2) + (-12) = 4 - 2 - 12 = 2 - 12 = -10 \\neq 0$\n   So, when $c = -12$, the numerator is zero at $x = -3$ and non-zero at $x = 2$. In this case, there is a hole at $x=-3$ and a vertical asymptote at $x=2$, thus exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n   Case 2: Numerator is zero at $x = 2$ and non-zero at $x = -3$.\n   If the numerator is zero at $x = 2$, then substitute $x = 2$ into the numerator and set it to zero:\n   $(2)^2 - (2) + c = 0$\n   $4 - 2 + c = 0$\n   $2 + c = 0$\n   $c = -2$\n   Now check if the numerator is non-zero at $x = -3$ when $c = -2$:\n   $(-3)^2 - (-3) + (-2) = 9 + 3 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 \\neq 0$\n   So, when $c = -2$, the numerator is zero at $x = 2$ and non-zero at $x = -3$. In this case, there is a hole at $x=2$ and a vertical asymptote at $x=-3$, thus exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n   Case 3: Numerator is zero at both $x = -3$ and $x = 2$.\n   As shown in the thought process, it's impossible for the numerator to be zero at both $x=-3$ and $x=2$ for a single value of $c$.\n\n3. **List the possible values of $c$:**\n   From Case 1, $c = -12$.\n   From Case 2, $c = -2$.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   For $c = -12$, $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x-12}{x^2+x-6} = \\frac{(x-4)(x+3)}{(x+3)(x-2)} = \\frac{x-4}{x-2}$ for $x \\neq -3$. Vertical asymptote at $x=2$.\n   For $c = -2$, $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x-2}{x^2+x-6} = \\frac{(x-2)(x+1)}{(x-2)(x+3)} = \\frac{x+1}{x+3}$ for $x \\neq 2$. Vertical asymptote at $x=-3$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{-12, -2}$",

The function can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{x^2 - c}{x - 1}\n\\]\n\nTo find the values of \\( c \\) that affect the graph, we need to consider the behavior of the function, particularly at \\( x = 1 \\), where the denominator becomes zero. \n\n1. **Finding the limit as \\( x \\) approaches 1**:\n   We can find the limit of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 1 to see if the function can be defined at that point:\n\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{x \\to 1} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - c}{x - 1}\n   \\]\n\n   If we substitute \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   f(1) = \\frac{1^2 - c}{1 - 1} = \\frac{1 - c}{0}\n   \\]\n\n   This expression is undefined unless the numerator also equals zero. Therefore, we set the numerator equal to zero:\n\n   \\[\n   1 - c = 0 \\implies c = 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Conclusion**:\n   The function \\( f(x) \\) will have a removable discontinuity at \\( x = 1 \\) if \\( c = 1 \\). In this case, we can redefine \\( f(1) \\) to be the limit value, which can be calculated as follows:\n\n   \\[\n   f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = \\frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x - 1} = x + 1 \\quad \\text{for } x \\neq 1\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, if \\( c = 1 \\), we can define \\( f(1) = 2 \\) to make the function continuous at that point.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( c \\) for which the graph of \\( f(x) \\) has a removable discontinuity is:\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{1} \\)."
