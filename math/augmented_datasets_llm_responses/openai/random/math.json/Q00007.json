  "solution": "### 1. Problem Statement\nFind all real numbers $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^4+(2-x)^4=34$.\n\nKey variables: $x$\nConstraint: $x$ must be a real number.\nEquation: $x^4+(2-x)^4=34$\n\n### 2. Solution Strategy\nWe will use a substitution to simplify the equation.\nLet $y = x-1$. Then $x = y+1$, and $2-x = 2-(y+1) = 1-y$.\nSubstituting these into the equation, we get $(y+1)^4 + (1-y)^4 = 34$.\nExpanding $(y+1)^4$ and $(1-y)^4$ using the binomial theorem and simplifying will lead to a simpler equation in terms of $y$. Then we solve for $y$ and then for $x$.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Binomial Theorem: $(a+b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Solution\nLet $y = x-1$. Then $x = y+1$, and $2-x = 2-(y+1) = 1-y$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$(y+1)^4 + (1-y)^4 = 34$\n\nExpand $(y+1)^4$ using the binomial theorem:\n$(y+1)^4 = \\binom{4}{0} y^4 1^0 + \\binom{4}{1} y^3 1^1 + \\binom{4}{2} y^2 1^2 + \\binom{4}{3} y^1 1^3 + \\binom{4}{4} y^0 1^4$\n$(y+1)^4 = 1 \\cdot y^4 + 4 \\cdot y^3 + 6 \\cdot y^2 + 4 \\cdot y + 1$\n$(y+1)^4 = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 1$\n\nExpand $(1-y)^4$ using the binomial theorem:\n$(1-y)^4 = \\binom{4}{0} 1^4 (-y)^0 + \\binom{4}{1} 1^3 (-y)^1 + \\binom{4}{2} 1^2 (-y)^2 + \\binom{4}{3} 1^1 (-y)^3 + \\binom{4}{4} 1^0 (-y)^4$\n$(1-y)^4 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 4 \\cdot (-y) + 6 \\cdot (-y)^2 + 4 \\cdot (-y)^3 + 1 \\cdot (-y)^4$\n$(1-y)^4 = 1 - 4y + 6y^2 - 4y^3 + y^4$\n\nAdd $(y+1)^4$ and $(1-y)^4$:\n$(y+1)^4 + (1-y)^4 = (y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 1) + (y^4 - 4y^3 + 6y^2 - 4y + 1)$\n$(y+1)^4 + (1-y)^4 = 2y^4 + 12y^2 + 2$\n\nSubstitute this back into the equation:\n$2y^4 + 12y^2 + 2 = 34$\n$2y^4 + 12y^2 - 32 = 0$\nDivide by 2:\n$y^4 + 6y^2 - 16 = 0$\n\nLet $z = y^2$. Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in $z$:\n$z^2 + 6z - 16 = 0$\nUse the quadratic formula to solve for $z$:\n$z = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{6^2 - 4(1)(-16)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 64}}{2} = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = \\frac{-6 \\pm 10}{2}$\n\nTwo possible values for $z$:\n$z_1 = \\frac{-6 + 10}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$\n$z_2 = \\frac{-6 - 10}{2} = \\frac{-16}{2} = -8$\n\nSince $z = y^2$ and $y$ is a real number, $z$ must be non-negative. Thus, $z = 2$ is the only valid solution for $z$.\n$y^2 = 2$\n$y = \\pm \\sqrt{2}$\n\nSince $x = y+1$, we have two solutions for $x$:\n$x_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{2}$\n$x_2 = 1 - \\sqrt{2}$\n\nVerify the solutions:\nFor $x = 1 + \\sqrt{2}$:\n$x^4 + (2-x)^4 = (1+\\sqrt{2})^4 + (2-(1+\\sqrt{2}))^4 = (1+\\sqrt{2})^4 + (1-\\sqrt{2})^4 = 34$ (as shown in the thought process)\n\nFor $x = 1 - \\sqrt{2}$:\n$x^4 + (2-x)^4 = (1-\\sqrt{2})^4 + (2-(1-\\sqrt{2}))^4 = (1-\\sqrt{2})^4 + (1+\\sqrt{2})^4 = 34$ (as shown in the thought process)\n\nBoth solutions are verified.\n\n### 4. Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1+\\sqrt{2}, 1-\\sqrt{2}}$",

          "To solve the expression \\( ^ + (-) ^ = $, ., \\), we need to clarify the symbols used. However, it seems that the expression is not standard mathematical notation. \n\nIf we interpret the symbols as placeholders for numbers or operations, we can assign values to them. For example, if we let \\( ^ = 1 \\), \\( + = + \\), \\( (-) = -1 \\), and \\( $ = 0 \\), we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n\\[\n1 + (-1) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n1 - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the left side equals the right side, confirming our interpretation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."
