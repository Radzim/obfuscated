So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n        $(x^2 - 10x + 25) - 50y^2 = 0$\n        The first three terms form a perfect square: $(x - 5)^2$.\n        So the equation becomes:\n        $(x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0$\n        This equation is in the form $X^2 - Y^2 = 0$, where $X = (x - 5)$ and $Y = \\sqrt{50}y$.\n        We can factor this equation as a difference of squares:\n        $[(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y][(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y] = 0$\n        This means either $(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y = 0$ or $(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y = 0$.\n        These are the equations of two lines:\n        Line 1: $(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y = 0 \\implies \\sqrt{50}y = (x - 5) \\implies y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}}(x - 5) = \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2}}(x - 5) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}(x - 5)$\n        Line 2: $(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y = 0 \\implies -\\sqrt{50}y = (x - 5) \\implies y = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}}(x - 5) = -\\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2}}(x - 5) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}(x - 5)$\n        These are two distinct lines passing through the point $(5, 0)$ with slopes $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}$ and $-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}$.\n        Therefore, the graph of the equation is two lines.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Final Answer}\n        \\boxed{\\text{two lines}}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n```",

          "The given equation is $x^2 - 50y^2 - 10x + 25 = 0$. We can rewrite this equation by completing the square for the $x$ terms:\n$(x^2 - 10x) - 50y^2 + 25 = 0$\n$(x^2 - 10x + 25) - 25 - 50y^2 + 25 = 0$\n$(x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0$\n$(x - 5)^2 = 50y^2$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n$x - 5 = \\pm \\sqrt{50y^2}$\n$x - 5 = \\pm \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 25y^2}$\n$x - 5 = \\pm 5\\sqrt{2}y$\n$x = 5 \\pm 5\\sqrt{2}y$\nThis represents two lines:\n$x = 5 + 5\\sqrt{2}y$ and $x = 5 - 5\\sqrt{2}y$\nThese are two lines intersecting at the point $(5, 0)$.\n\nThe equation $x^2 - 50y^2 - 10x + 25 = 0$ can be rewritten as $(x-5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0$. This is a degenerate hyperbola, which consists of two intersecting lines.\nThe two lines are $x - 5 = \\pm \\sqrt{50}y$, so $x - 5 = \\pm 5\\sqrt{2}y$.\nThus, $x = 5 \\pm 5\\sqrt{2}y$.\nThe two lines are $x = 5 + 5\\sqrt{2}y$ and $x = 5 - 5\\sqrt{2}y$.\n\nThe question asks to identify the r3QOB of the s1JWGl9M H@Ila. The given options are (wdqHK>A, v&FSi3, wkoo0QR, T%l$gh0;X, 0LOG%, <kBf, two >jgDq, or 4n9FH).\nThe equation $x^2 - 50y^2 - 10x + 25 = 0$ represents two lines.\nTherefore, the r3QOB of the s1JWGl9M H@Ila is \"two >jgDq\".\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{two >jgDq}$"
