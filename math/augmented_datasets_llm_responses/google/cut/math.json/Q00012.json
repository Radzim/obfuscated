  "solution": "## Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\nFactor the polynomial $w^4-16$ into a product of monic polynomials with real coefficients such that no factor can be further factored into monic polynomials with real coefficients of lower degree.\n\n**Key Variables and Constraints:**\n- Polynomial to factor: $w^4-16$\n- Variable: $w$\n- Type of factors: Monic polynomials\n- Coefficient type: Real coefficients\n- Factorization requirement: As far as possible\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\nWe will use the difference of squares factorization formula repeatedly and check for irreducibility of quadratic factors over real numbers using the discriminant.\n\n**Relevant Formulas/Theorems:**\n- Difference of Squares: $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$\n- Discriminant of a quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$: $\\Delta = b^2-4ac$. If $\\Delta < 0$, the quadratic has no real roots and is irreducible over real numbers.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1:** Recognize the given polynomial as a difference of squares.\nWe observe that $w^4 = (w^2)^2$ and $16 = 4^2$.\nThus, $w^4-16 = (w^2)^2 - 4^2$.\n\n**Step 2:** Apply the difference of squares formula.\nUsing $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$ with $a = w^2$ and $b = 4$, we have:\n$w^4-16 = (w^2-4)(w^2+4)$.\n\n**Step 3:** Factor the first quadratic factor $w^2-4$.\nWe observe that $w^2-4 = w^2 - 2^2$, which is again a difference of squares.\nUsing $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$ with $a = w$ and $b = 2$, we have:\n$w^2-4 = (w-2)(w+2)$.\n\n**Step 4:** Consider the second quadratic factor $w^2+4$.\nWe need to check if $w^2+4$ can be factored further into monic polynomials with real coefficients.\nWe examine the discriminant of the quadratic $w^2+4$. Here, $a=1$, $b=0$, and $c=4$.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 0^2 - 4(1)(4) = -16$.\nSince $\\Delta = -16 < 0$, the quadratic $w^2+4$ has no real roots. Therefore, it cannot be factored into linear factors with real coefficients. As a quadratic polynomial with no real roots, it is irreducible over real numbers.\n\n**Step 5:** Combine the factors.\nSubstituting the factorization of $w^2-4$ back into the expression from Step 2, we get:\n$w^4-16 = (w^2-4)(w^2+4) = (w-2)(w+2)(w^2+4)$.\n\n**Step 6:** Verify the factors are monic polynomials with real coefficients.\n- $(w-2)$ is a polynomial of degree 1. The leading coefficient (coefficient of $w$) is 1, so it is monic. The coefficients are real (-2 and 1).\n- $(w+2)$ is a polynomial of degree 1. The leading coefficient (coefficient of $w$) is 1, so it is monic. The coefficients are real (2 and 1).\n- $(w^2+4)$ is a polynomial of degree 2. The leading coefficient (coefficient of $w^2$) is 1, so it is monic. The coefficients are real (4, 0, and 1).\n\n**Step 7:** Verify that the product of the factors is $w^4-16$.\n$(w-2)(w+2)(w^2+4) = (w^2 - 2^2)(w^2+4) = (w^2-4)(w^2+4) = (w^2)^2 - 4^2 = w^4 - 16$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\nThe factorization of $w^4-16$ as far as possible into monic polynomials with real coefficients is $\\boxed{(w-2)(w+2)(w^2+4)}$.",
