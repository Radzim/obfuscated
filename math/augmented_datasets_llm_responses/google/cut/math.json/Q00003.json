So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n        $(x^2 - 10x + 25) - 50y^2 = 0$\n        The first three terms form a perfect square: $(x - 5)^2$.\n        So the equation becomes:\n        $(x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0$\n        This equation is in the form $X^2 - Y^2 = 0$, where $X = (x - 5)$ and $Y = \\sqrt{50}y$.\n        We can factor this equation as a difference of squares:\n        $[(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y][(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y] = 0$\n        This means either $(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y = 0$ or $(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y = 0$.\n        These are the equations of two lines:\n        Line 1: $(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y = 0 \\implies \\sqrt{50}y = (x - 5) \\implies y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}}(x - 5) = \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2}}(x - 5) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}(x - 5)$\n        Line 2: $(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y = 0 \\implies -\\sqrt{50}y = (x - 5) \\implies y = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}}(x - 5) = -\\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2}}(x - 5) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}(x - 5)$\n        These are two distinct lines passing through the point $(5, 0)$ with slopes $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}$ and $-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}$.\n        Therefore, the graph of the equation is two lines.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Final Answer}\n        \\boxed{\\text{two lines}}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n```",
