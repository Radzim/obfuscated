  "solution": "**Problem Statement**\n\nDetermine the values of the constant $c$ for which the rational function $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x+c}{x^2+x-6}$ has exactly one vertical asymptote.\nKey variables: $c$, function $f(x)$.\nConstraint: exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n**Solution Strategy**\n\nA vertical asymptote of a rational function occurs at the values of $x$ where the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero.\nFirst, find the roots of the denominator $x^2+x-6=0$.\nThen, for the function to have exactly one vertical asymptote, the numerator $x^2-x+c$ must be zero at exactly one of these roots and non-zero at the other root.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Find the roots of the denominator:**\n   Set the denominator $x^2+x-6 = 0$.\n   Factor the quadratic equation: $(x+3)(x-2) = 0$.\n   The roots of the denominator are $x = -3$ and $x = 2$.\n   These are the potential locations of vertical asymptotes.\n\n2. **Analyze the numerator for each root of the denominator:**\n   For exactly one vertical asymptote, the numerator $x^2-x+c$ must be zero for one of $x = -3$ or $x = 2$, and non-zero for the other.\n\n   Case 1: Numerator is zero at $x = -3$ and non-zero at $x = 2$.\n   If the numerator is zero at $x = -3$, then substitute $x = -3$ into the numerator and set it to zero:\n   $(-3)^2 - (-3) + c = 0$\n   $9 + 3 + c = 0$\n   $12 + c = 0$\n   $c = -12$\n   Now check if the numerator is non-zero at $x = 2$ when $c = -12$:\n   $(2)^2 - (2) + (-12) = 4 - 2 - 12 = 2 - 12 = -10 \\neq 0$\n   So, when $c = -12$, the numerator is zero at $x = -3$ and non-zero at $x = 2$. In this case, there is a hole at $x=-3$ and a vertical asymptote at $x=2$, thus exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n   Case 2: Numerator is zero at $x = 2$ and non-zero at $x = -3$.\n   If the numerator is zero at $x = 2$, then substitute $x = 2$ into the numerator and set it to zero:\n   $(2)^2 - (2) + c = 0$\n   $4 - 2 + c = 0$\n   $2 + c = 0$\n   $c = -2$\n   Now check if the numerator is non-zero at $x = -3$ when $c = -2$:\n   $(-3)^2 - (-3) + (-2) = 9 + 3 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 \\neq 0$\n   So, when $c = -2$, the numerator is zero at $x = 2$ and non-zero at $x = -3$. In this case, there is a hole at $x=2$ and a vertical asymptote at $x=-3$, thus exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n   Case 3: Numerator is zero at both $x = -3$ and $x = 2$.\n   As shown in the thought process, it's impossible for the numerator to be zero at both $x=-3$ and $x=2$ for a single value of $c$.\n\n3. **List the possible values of $c$:**\n   From Case 1, $c = -12$.\n   From Case 2, $c = -2$.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   For $c = -12$, $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x-12}{x^2+x-6} = \\frac{(x-4)(x+3)}{(x+3)(x-2)} = \\frac{x-4}{x-2}$ for $x \\neq -3$. Vertical asymptote at $x=2$.\n   For $c = -2$, $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x-2}{x^2+x-6} = \\frac{(x-2)(x+1)}{(x-2)(x+3)} = \\frac{x+1}{x+3}$ for $x \\neq 2$. Vertical asymptote at $x=-3$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{-12, -2}$",

          "Let $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - cx + 1}{x^2 + cx + 1}$. We want to find the values of $c$ for which the range of $f(x)$ is the set of all real numbers.\nLet $y = f(x)$. Then $y = \\frac{x^2 - cx + 1}{x^2 + cx + 1}$.\nWe want to find the values of $c$ such that for any real number $y$, there exists a real number $x$ such that $y = \\frac{x^2 - cx + 1}{x^2 + cx + 1}$.\nMultiplying both sides by $x^2 + cx + 1$, we get\n$y(x^2 + cx + 1) = x^2 - cx + 1$\n$yx^2 + cxy + y = x^2 - cx + 1$\n$(y-1)x^2 + (cy+c)x + (y-1) = 0$\n$(y-1)x^2 + c(y+1)x + (y-1) = 0$\nFor $x$ to be a real number, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be non-negative.\nThe discriminant is\n$D = (c(y+1))^2 - 4(y-1)(y-1) = c^2(y+1)^2 - 4(y-1)^2$\n$D = c^2(y^2 + 2y + 1) - 4(y^2 - 2y + 1) = c^2y^2 + 2c^2y + c^2 - 4y^2 + 8y - 4$\n$D = (c^2-4)y^2 + (2c^2+8)y + (c^2-4)$\nWe want $D \\ge 0$ for all real numbers $y$.\nIf $c^2 - 4 = 0$, then $c^2 = 4$, so $c = \\pm 2$.\nIf $c = 2$, then $D = (2(2^2)+8)y = 16y$.\nIf $c = -2$, then $D = (2(-2)^2+8)y = 16y$.\nIn either case, $D = 16y$, which is not always non-negative.\nIf $c^2 - 4 > 0$, then the parabola opens upwards, and we need the discriminant of the quadratic in $y$ to be non-positive.\nIf $c^2 - 4 < 0$, then the parabola opens downwards, and we need the quadratic in $y$ to be non-negative for all $y$. This is impossible.\nSo we must have $c^2 - 4 > 0$.\nThe discriminant of the quadratic in $y$ is\n$D_y = (2c^2+8)^2 - 4(c^2-4)(c^2-4) = 4(c^2+4)^2 - 4(c^2-4)^2$\n$D_y = 4[(c^2+4)^2 - (c^2-4)^2] = 4[(c^4+8c^2+16) - (c^4-8c^2+16)] = 4(16c^2) = 64c^2$\nWe want $D_y \\le 0$, so $64c^2 \\le 0$, which means $c=0$.\nHowever, we need $c^2 - 4 > 0$, so $c^2 > 4$, which means $c > 2$ or $c < -2$.\nIf $c=0$, then $f(x) = \\frac{x^2+1}{x^2+1} = 1$, so the range is just $\\{1\\}$.\nWe want $D \\ge 0$ for all $y$.\n$(c^2-4)y^2 + (2c^2+8)y + (c^2-4) \\ge 0$\nIf $c^2-4 = 0$, then $c = \\pm 2$.\nIf $c=2$, then $16y \\ge 0$, which is not true for all $y$.\nIf $c=-2$, then $16y \\ge 0$, which is not true for all $y$.\nIf $c^2-4 > 0$, then $c^2 > 4$, so $c > 2$ or $c < -2$.\nWe need the discriminant of the quadratic in $y$ to be non-positive.\n$D_y = (2c^2+8)^2 - 4(c^2-4)^2 = 4(c^2+4)^2 - 4(c^2-4)^2 = 4(c^4+8c^2+16 - (c^4-8c^2+16)) = 4(16c^2) = 64c^2$\nWe need $64c^2 \\le 0$, so $c=0$. But $c^2 > 4$, so this is impossible.\nIf $c^2-4 < 0$, then $c^2 < 4$, so $-2 < c < 2$.\nThen the parabola opens downwards, so we can't have $D \\ge 0$ for all $y$.\nConsider $y=1$. Then $(y-1)x^2 + c(y+1)x + (y-1) = 0$ becomes $2cx = 0$, so $x=0$.\nThen $f(0) = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\nIf $y=-1$, then $-2x^2 + 0x - 2 = 0$, so $x^2 = -1$, which has no real solution.\nSo $y=-1$ is not in the range.\nWe want the range to be all real numbers.\nIf $c=0$, then $f(x) = \\frac{x^2+1}{x^2+1} = 1$, so the range is $\\{1\\}$.\nIf $c=2\\sqrt{2}$, then $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 1}{x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 1} = \\frac{(x-\\sqrt{2})^2 - 1}{(x+\\sqrt{2})^2 - 1}$.\nIf $c=2$, then $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-2x+1}{x^2+2x+1} = \\frac{(x-1)^2}{(x+1)^2} \\ge 0$.\nSo the range is $[0, \\infty)$.\nIf $c > 2$, then $f(x)$ can take on negative values.\nIf $c=2\\sqrt{2}$, then $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 1}{x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 1}$.\nIf $x=0$, then $f(0) = 1$.\nIf $x=1$, then $f(1) = \\frac{2-2\\sqrt{2}}{2+2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{2}}{1+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(1-\\sqrt{2})^2}{1-2} = \\frac{1-2\\sqrt{2}+2}{-1} = -3+2\\sqrt{2}$.\nIf $c=2$, then $f(x) = \\frac{(x-1)^2}{(x+1)^2}$.\nIf $c=0$, then $f(x) = 1$.\nIf $c=2\\sqrt{2}$, then $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 1}{x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 1}$.\nIf $c > 2$, then the range is all real numbers.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{(-\\infty, -2) \\cup (2, \\infty)}$."
