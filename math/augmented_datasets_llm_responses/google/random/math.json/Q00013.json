  "solution": "## Solution\n\n1. **Problem Statement**\nSolve the equation\n\\[\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{x}}} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + \\sqrt{x}}.\\]\nThe variable is $x$. We need to find the value(s) of $x$ that satisfy this equation. We must have $x \\ge 0$ for $\\sqrt{x}$ to be defined in real numbers. Also, for the nested square roots to be defined, we need $2 + \\sqrt{x} \\ge 0$, which is always true for $x \\ge 0$. And $1 + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{x}} \\ge 0$, which is also always true. For the cube root, $1 + \\sqrt{x}$ can be any non-negative value.\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\nLet $y = \\sqrt{x}$. Then $y \\ge 0$ and $x = y^2$. Substituting $y$ into the equation, we get\n\\[\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + y}} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + y}.\\]\nTo eliminate the radicals, we raise both sides to the power of 6 (the least common multiple of 2 and 3):\n\\[(\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + y}})^6 = (\\sqrt[3]{1 + y})^6\\]\n\\[(1 + \\sqrt{2 + y})^3 = (1 + y)^2\\]\nExpand both sides and simplify to obtain a polynomial equation in terms of $y$. Solve for $y$ and then find $x = y^2$. Finally, we need to verify the solution in the original equation.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\nLet $y = \\sqrt{x}$. The equation becomes\n\\[\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + y}} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + y}.\\]\nRaise both sides to the power of 6:\n\\[(1 + \\sqrt{2 + y})^3 = (1 + y)^2\\]\nExpand the left side using the binomial expansion $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$ with $a = 1$ and $b = \\sqrt{2 + y}$:\n\\[1^3 + 3 \\cdot 1^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2 + y} + 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2 + y})^2 + (\\sqrt{2 + y})^3 = (1 + y)^2\\]\n\\[1 + 3\\sqrt{2 + y} + 3(2 + y) + (2 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = (1 + y)^2\\]\n\\[1 + 3\\sqrt{2 + y} + 6 + 3y + (2 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = 1 + 2y + y^2\\]\nCombine the terms without square roots:\n\\[7 + 3y + (3 + 2 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = 1 + 2y + y^2\\]\n\\[7 + 3y + (5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = 1 + 2y + y^2\\]\nIsolate the term with the square root:\n\\[(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = 1 + 2y + y^2 - 7 - 3y\\]\n\\[(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = y^2 - y - 6\\]\nFactor the quadratic expression on the right side:\n\\[(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = (y - 3)(y + 2)\\]\nSquare both sides to remove the square root:\n\\[(5 + y)^2 (2 + y) = (y - 3)^2 (y + 2)^2\\]\nSince we are looking for $y \\ge 0$, we know that $y + 2 \\ne 0$. If $y > -2$, we can divide both sides by $(y + 2)$:\n\\[(5 + y)^2 = (y - 3)^2 (y + 2)\\]\nExpand both sides:\n\\[25 + 10y + y^2 = (y^2 - 6y + 9)(y + 2)\\]\n\\[25 + 10y + y^2 = y^3 + 2y^2 - 6y^2 - 12y + 9y + 18\\]\n\\[25 + 10y + y^2 = y^3 - 4y^2 - 3y + 18\\]\nRearrange to form a cubic equation:\n\\[y^3 - 4y^2 - 3y + 18 - y^2 - 10y - 25 = 0\\]\n\\[y^3 - 5y^2 - 13y - 7 = 0\\]\nWe test integer roots that are divisors of $-7$, which are $\\pm 1, \\pm 7$.\nFor $y = 7$: $7^3 - 5(7^2) - 13(7) - 7 = 343 - 5(49) - 91 - 7 = 343 - 245 - 91 - 7 = 343 - 343 = 0$.\nSo $y = 7$ is a root. Thus $(y - 7)$ is a factor. We perform polynomial division or synthetic division to find the other factor.\nDividing $y^3 - 5y^2 - 13y - 7$ by $(y - 7)$:\n\\[y^3 - 5y^2 - 13y - 7 = (y - 7)(y^2 + 2y + 1)\\]\nThe quadratic factor is $y^2 + 2y + 1 = (y + 1)^2$.\nSo the equation becomes $(y - 7)(y + 1)^2 = 0$.\nThe roots are $y = 7$ and $y = -1$ (double root).\nSince $y = \\sqrt{x} \\ge 0$, we must have $y = 7$.\nThen $\\sqrt{x} = 7$, so $x = 7^2 = 49$.\n\nWe need to check if $x = 49$ is a solution to the original equation.\nLHS = $\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{49}}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + 7}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{9}} = \\sqrt{1 + 3} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nRHS = $\\sqrt[3]{1 + \\sqrt{49}} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + 7} = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$.\nLHS = RHS.\nSo $x = 49$ is a valid solution.\n\nWe should also check if $y = -1$ leads to any issues when squaring.\nFor $y = -1$, LHS of $(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = (5 - 1)\\sqrt{2 - 1} = 4\\sqrt{1} = 4$.\nRHS of $(y - 3)(y + 2) = (-1 - 3)(-1 + 2) = (-4)(1) = -4$.\nLHS $\\ne$ RHS.\nSo $y = -1$ is not a solution to $(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = (y - 3)(y + 2)$.\nTherefore, $y = -1$ is an extraneous root introduced by squaring.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{49}$",
