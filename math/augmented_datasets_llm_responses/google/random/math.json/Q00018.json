  "solution": "### Problem Statement\nLet $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $z$ be complex numbers such that $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$ and\n\\[az^2 + bz + c = 0.\\]\nWe need to find the largest possible value of $|z|.$\n\nKey variables: $a, b, c, z \\in \\mathbb{C}$\nConstraints: $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$, $az^2 + bz + c = 0$\n\n### Solution Strategy\nWe can simplify the equation by dividing by $a$ (since $a \\neq 0$). Let $B = b/a$ and $C = c/a$. Then the equation becomes $z^2 + Bz + C = 0$.\nFrom the given condition $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$, we have $|B| = |b/a| = |b|/|a| = 1$ and $|C| = |c/a| = |c|/|a| = 1$.\nWe use the quadratic formula to solve for $z$:\n\\[z = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}}{2}.\\]\nWe want to maximize $|z| = \\frac{|-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2} = \\frac{|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2}.$\nTo maximize $|z|$, we need to maximize $|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|.$\nUsing the triangle inequality, $|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| \\le |B| + |\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = 1 + \\sqrt{|B^2 - 4C|}.$\nTo maximize $|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|$, we need to maximize $|B^2 - 4C|.$\nBy the triangle inequality, $|B^2 - 4C| \\le |B^2| + |-4C| = |B|^2 + 4|C| = 1^2 + 4(1) = 5.$\nThe maximum value of $|B^2 - 4C|$ is achieved when $B^2$ and $-4C$ have the same argument.\nLet $B = 1$ (so $B^2 = 1$). To make $-4C$ have the same argument as $B^2 = 1$ (argument 0), we need $-4C$ to be a positive real number. Let $-4C = 4$, so $C = -1$. Then $|B| = |1| = 1$ and $|C| = |-1| = 1$.\nIn this case, $B^2 - 4C = 1 - 4(-1) = 5.$\nThen $\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C} = \\sqrt{5}.$\nWe choose the minus sign to maximize $|B - \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = |1 - \\sqrt{5}| = \\sqrt{5} - 1.$\nWe choose the plus sign to maximize $|B + \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = |1 + \\sqrt{5}| = 1 + \\sqrt{5}.$\nThe larger value is $1 + \\sqrt{5}.$\nThen the maximum value of $|z| = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Divide by $a$**: Since $a \\neq 0,$ we divide the equation $az^2 + bz + c = 0$ by $a$ to get $z^2 + \\frac{b}{a}z + \\frac{c}{a} = 0.$\n2. **Substitute $B = b/a$ and $C = c/a$**: Let $B = \\frac{b}{a}$ and $C = \\frac{c}{a}.$ Then the equation becomes $z^2 + Bz + C = 0.$\n3. **Determine magnitudes of $B$ and $C$**: Since $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0,$ we have $|B| = |\\frac{b}{a}| = \\frac{|b|}{|a|} = 1$ and $|C| = |\\frac{c}{a}| = \\frac{|c|}{|a|} = 1.$\n4. **Apply the quadratic formula**: The solutions for $z$ are given by $z = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}}{2}.$\n5. **Maximize $|z|$**: We want to maximize $|z| = \\frac{|-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2} = \\frac{|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2}.$ To maximize $|z|,$ we need to maximize $|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|.$\n6. **Maximize $|\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|$**: We have $|\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = \\sqrt{|B^2 - 4C|}.$ By triangle inequality, $|B^2 - 4C| \\le |B^2| + |4C| = |B|^2 + 4|C| = 1^2 + 4(1) = 5.$ The maximum value of $|B^2 - 4C|$ is $5.$ This is achieved when $B^2$ and $-4C$ have the same argument.\n7. **Choose $B$ and $C$ to achieve maximum $|B^2 - 4C|$**: Let $B = 1,$ then $B^2 = 1.$ To make $-4C$ have the same argument as $B^2 = 1,$ we choose $-4C = 4,$ so $C = -1.$ Then $|B| = 1$ and $|C| = 1,$ which satisfy the conditions.\n8. **Calculate $z$ with chosen $B$ and $C$**: With $B = 1$ and $C = -1,$ $z = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(-1)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n9. **Find the largest $|z|$**: We have two solutions $z_1 = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $z_2 = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n$|z_1| = |\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}| = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}.$\n$|z_2| = |\\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}| = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\nThe largest value is $|z_2| = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}$",

          "Let $a, b, c$ be complex numbers such that $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$.\nAlso, $az^2 + bz + c = 0$.\nWe want to find the value of $|z|$.\nSince $az^2 + bz + c = 0$, we can divide by $a$ to get\n$z^2 + \\frac{b}{a} z + \\frac{c}{a} = 0$.\nLet $z_1, z_2$ be the roots of this quadratic equation.\nThen $z_1 + z_2 = -\\frac{b}{a}$ and $z_1 z_2 = \\frac{c}{a}$.\nTaking the absolute value, we have\n$|z_1 + z_2| = \\left| -\\frac{b}{a} \\right| = \\frac{|b|}{|a|} = 1$\n$|z_1 z_2| = \\left| \\frac{c}{a} \\right| = \\frac{|c|}{|a|} = 1$\nThus, $|z_1 z_2| = |z_1| |z_2| = 1$.\nLet $|z_1| = r$. Then $|z_2| = \\frac{1}{r}$.\nWe have $|z_1 + z_2| = 1$.\nBy the triangle inequality, $|z_1 + z_2| \\le |z_1| + |z_2|$, so $1 \\le r + \\frac{1}{r}$.\nAlso, $|z_1 + z_2| \\ge ||z_1| - |z_2||$, so $1 \\ge |r - \\frac{1}{r}|$.\nThis means $-1 \\le r - \\frac{1}{r} \\le 1$.\nIf $r - \\frac{1}{r} \\le 1$, then $r^2 - r - 1 \\le 0$.\nThe roots of $r^2 - r - 1 = 0$ are $r = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+4}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\nSince $r > 0$, we have $r \\le \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\nIf $r - \\frac{1}{r} \\ge -1$, then $r^2 + r - 1 \\ge 0$.\nThe roots of $r^2 + r - 1 = 0$ are $r = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+4}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\nSince $r > 0$, we have $r \\ge \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\nThus, $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \\le r \\le \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$.\nHowever, we are looking for a specific value of $|z|$.\nConsider the case where $|a| = |b| = |c| = 1$.\nThen $|z_1 z_2| = 1$, so $|z_1| |z_2| = 1$.\nAlso, $|z_1 + z_2| = 1$.\nIf $|z_1| = |z_2| = 1$, then $|z_1 + z_2| \\le |z_1| + |z_2| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\nIf $z_1 = 1$ and $z_2 = -1$, then $|z_1 + z_2| = 0$, which is not 1.\nIf $z_1 = e^{i \\theta}$ and $z_2 = e^{-i \\theta}$, then $|z_1 z_2| = 1$ and $z_1 + z_2 = e^{i \\theta} + e^{-i \\theta} = 2 \\cos \\theta$.\nWe want $|2 \\cos \\theta| = 1$, so $| \\cos \\theta | = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThen $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ or $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\nIn this case, $|z_1| = |z_2| = 1$.\nIf $|z_1| = 1$, then $|z_2| = 1$.\nThen $|z| = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$"
