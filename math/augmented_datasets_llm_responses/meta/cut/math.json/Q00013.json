  "solution": "## Solution\n\n1. **Problem Statement**\nSolve the equation\n\\[\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{x}}} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + \\sqrt{x}}.\\]\nThe variable is $x$. We need to find the value(s) of $x$ that satisfy this equation. We must have $x \\ge 0$ for $\\sqrt{x}$ to be defined in real numbers. Also, for the nested square roots to be defined, we need $2 + \\sqrt{x} \\ge 0$, which is always true for $x \\ge 0$. And $1 + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{x}} \\ge 0$, which is also always true. For the cube root, $1 + \\sqrt{x}$ can be any non-negative value.\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\nLet $y = \\sqrt{x}$. Then $y \\ge 0$ and $x = y^2$. Substituting $y$ into the equation, we get\n\\[\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + y}} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + y}.\\]\nTo eliminate the radicals, we raise both sides to the power of 6 (the least common multiple of 2 and 3):\n\\[(\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + y}})^6 = (\\sqrt[3]{1 + y})^6\\]\n\\[(1 + \\sqrt{2 + y})^3 = (1 + y)^2\\]\nExpand both sides and simplify to obtain a polynomial equation in terms of $y$. Solve for $y$ and then find $x = y^2$. Finally, we need to verify the solution in the original equation.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\nLet $y = \\sqrt{x}$. The equation becomes\n\\[\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + y}} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + y}.\\]\nRaise both sides to the power of 6:\n\\[(1 + \\sqrt{2 + y})^3 = (1 + y)^2\\]\nExpand the left side using the binomial expansion $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$ with $a = 1$ and $b = \\sqrt{2 + y}$:\n\\[1^3 + 3 \\cdot 1^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2 + y} + 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2 + y})^2 + (\\sqrt{2 + y})^3 = (1 + y)^2\\]\n\\[1 + 3\\sqrt{2 + y} + 3(2 + y) + (2 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = (1 + y)^2\\]\n\\[1 + 3\\sqrt{2 + y} + 6 + 3y + (2 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = 1 + 2y + y^2\\]\nCombine the terms without square roots:\n\\[7 + 3y + (3 + 2 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = 1 + 2y + y^2\\]\n\\[7 + 3y + (5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = 1 + 2y + y^2\\]\nIsolate the term with the square root:\n\\[(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = 1 + 2y + y^2 - 7 - 3y\\]\n\\[(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = y^2 - y - 6\\]\nFactor the quadratic expression on the right side:\n\\[(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = (y - 3)(y + 2)\\]\nSquare both sides to remove the square root:\n\\[(5 + y)^2 (2 + y) = (y - 3)^2 (y + 2)^2\\]\nSince we are looking for $y \\ge 0$, we know that $y + 2 \\ne 0$. If $y > -2$, we can divide both sides by $(y + 2)$:\n\\[(5 + y)^2 = (y - 3)^2 (y + 2)\\]\nExpand both sides:\n\\[25 + 10y + y^2 = (y^2 - 6y + 9)(y + 2)\\]\n\\[25 + 10y + y^2 = y^3 + 2y^2 - 6y^2 - 12y + 9y + 18\\]\n\\[25 + 10y + y^2 = y^3 - 4y^2 - 3y + 18\\]\nRearrange to form a cubic equation:\n\\[y^3 - 4y^2 - 3y + 18 - y^2 - 10y - 25 = 0\\]\n\\[y^3 - 5y^2 - 13y - 7 = 0\\]\nWe test integer roots that are divisors of $-7$, which are $\\pm 1, \\pm 7$.\nFor $y = 7$: $7^3 - 5(7^2) - 13(7) - 7 = 343 - 5(49) - 91 - 7 = 343 - 245 - 91 - 7 = 343 - 343 = 0$.\nSo $y = 7$ is a root. Thus $(y - 7)$ is a factor. We perform polynomial division or synthetic division to find the other factor.\nDividing $y^3 - 5y^2 - 13y - 7$ by $(y - 7)$:\n\\[y^3 - 5y^2 - 13y - 7 = (y - 7)(y^2 + 2y + 1)\\]\nThe quadratic factor is $y^2 + 2y + 1 = (y + 1)^2$.\nSo the equation becomes $(y - 7)(y + 1)^2 = 0$.\nThe roots are $y = 7$ and $y = -1$ (double root).\nSince $y = \\sqrt{x} \\ge 0$, we must have $y = 7$.\nThen $\\sqrt{x} = 7$, so $x = 7^2 = 49$.\n\nWe need to check if $x = 49$ is a solution to the original equation.\nLHS = $\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{49}}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + 7}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{9}} = \\sqrt{1 + 3} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nRHS = $\\sqrt[3]{1 + \\sqrt{49}} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + 7} = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$.\nLHS = RHS.\nSo $x = 49$ is a valid solution.\n\nWe should also check if $y = -1$ leads to any issues when squaring.\nFor $y = -1$, LHS of $(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = (5 - 1)\\sqrt{2 - 1} = 4\\sqrt{1} = 4$.\nRHS of $(y - 3)(y + 2) = (-1 - 3)(-1 + 2) = (-4)(1) = -4$.\nLHS $\\ne$ RHS.\nSo $y = -1$ is not a solution to $(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = (y - 3)(y + 2)$.\nTherefore, $y = -1$ is an extraneous root introduced by squaring.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{49}$",

          "## Step 1: Understand the given equation\nThe given equation is \\[\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{x}}} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{x}}}.\\] This equation involves nested square roots and a cube root.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equation by substitution\nTo simplify, let's substitute \\(\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{x}}\\) with \\(y\\), so the equation becomes \\[\\sqrt{1 + y} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + y}.\\]\n\n## Step 3: Raise both sides to the power of 6 to eliminate the roots\nRaising both sides to the power of 6 gives \\[(\\sqrt{1 + y})^6 = (\\sqrt[3]{1 + y})^6.\\] This simplifies to \\((1 + y)^3 = (1 + y)^2\\).\n\n## Step 4: Solve for \\(y\\)\nFrom \\((1 + y)^3 = (1 + y)^2\\), we can see that \\((1 + y)^2[(1 + y) - 1] = 0\\), which simplifies to \\((1 + y)^2(y) = 0\\). This gives us two possible solutions: \\(y = 0\\) or \\(1 + y = 0\\), which means \\(y = -1\\). However, since \\(y = \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{x}}\\), \\(y\\) cannot be negative, so we discard \\(y = -1\\).\n\n## Step 5: Solve for \\(x\\) using \\(y = 0\\)\nGiven \\(y = 0\\), we substitute back to find \\(\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{x}} = 0\\). Squaring both sides gives \\(2 + \\sqrt{x} = 0\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sqrt{x} = -2\\). However, the square root of a number cannot be negative in the real number system, so this solution is not valid for real \\(x\\). We revisit our steps to ensure no mistake was made in determining valid solutions.\n\n## Step 6: Re-evaluate the simplification process\nUpon re-evaluation, we note that the step of raising both sides to the power of 6 was correct, but we should also consider the case when \\(1 + y = 0\\), which was initially dismissed due to the nature of \\(y\\). However, our main error was in assuming that \\(y = 0\\) directly leads to a valid solution for \\(x\\) without considering the implications of \\(y = \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{x}}\\) properly.\n\n## Step 7: Correctly solve for \\(y\\)\nGiven that \\((1 + y)^3 = (1 + y)^2\\), we have \\((1 + y)^2 = 0\\) or \\(1 + y = 1\\). The first gives \\(y = -1\\), which is not valid as explained. The second, \\(1 + y = 1\\), implies \\(y = 0\\).\n\n## Step 8: Correct interpretation of \\(y = 0\\)\nIf \\(y = 0\\), then \\(\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{x}} = 0\\). Squaring both sides gives \\(2 + \\sqrt{x} = 0\\), or \\(\\sqrt{x} = -2\\). This is not possible for real \\(x\\) since \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) cannot be negative.\n\n## Step 9: Reconsider the equation with a focus on valid operations\nGiven the nature of the original equation and the steps taken, we recognize that our approach to directly solve for \\(x\\) from \\(y = 0\\) was flawed due to overlooking the domain of the square root function. We should instead focus on the validity of operations and the domain of the functions involved.\n\n## Step 10: Final analysis\nUpon final analysis, recognizing the mistake in handling \\(y = 0\\) and its implications, we see that our approach to solving the equation needs to respect the domains of the functions involved. The error in handling the square root of a negative number indicates a critical oversight in solving for \\(x\\).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$"
