  "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nGiven the numbers $36$, $300$, and $596$, we need to find an integer $k$ such that when $k$ is added to each of these numbers, the results are the squares of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series. We need to determine the value of $k$.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- $k$: integer to be found\n- $36, 300, 596$: given numbers\n- Arithmetic series: three consecutive terms\n- Squares: of the terms in the arithmetic series\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nLet the three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series be $a-d$, $a$, and $a+d$, where $a$ is the middle term and $d$ is the common difference. Their squares are $(a-d)^2$, $a^2$, and $(a+d)^2$.\nAccording to the problem statement, we have the following equations:\n1. $36 + k = (a-d)^2$\n2. $300 + k = a^2$\n3. $596 + k = (a+d)^2$\n\nWe can eliminate $k$ by subtracting the first equation from the second and the second equation from the third. This will give us two equations in terms of $a$ and $d$, which we can solve to find $a$ and $d$. Once we have $a$, we can substitute it back into the second equation to find $k$.\n\nRelevant formulas:\n- Square of binomial: $(x \\pm y)^2 = x^2 \\pm 2xy + y^2$\n- Arithmetic series definition: consecutive terms with a constant difference\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n$(300 + k) - (36 + k) = a^2 - (a-d)^2$\n$300 - 36 = a^2 - (a^2 - 2ad + d^2)$\n$264 = a^2 - a^2 + 2ad - d^2$\n$264 = 2ad - d^2$  (Equation 4)\n\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n$(596 + k) - (300 + k) = (a+d)^2 - a^2$\n$596 - 300 = (a^2 + 2ad + d^2) - a^2$\n$296 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2 - a^2$\n$296 = 2ad + d^2$  (Equation 5)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations in terms of $ad$ and $d^2$:\n$2ad - d^2 = 264$  (Equation 4)\n$2ad + d^2 = 296$  (Equation 5)\n\nAdd Equation 4 and Equation 5:\n$(2ad - d^2) + (2ad + d^2) = 264 + 296$\n$4ad = 560$\n$ad = \\frac{560}{4}$\n$ad = 140$  (Equation 6)\n\nSubtract Equation 4 from Equation 5:\n$(2ad + d^2) - (2ad - d^2) = 296 - 264$\n$2d^2 = 32$\n$d^2 = \\frac{32}{2}$\n$d^2 = 16$\n$d = \\pm \\sqrt{16}$\n$d = \\pm 4$\n\nWe can choose $d = 4$ (or $d = -4$, which would lead to the same result for $k$).\nSubstitute $d = 4$ into Equation 6:\n$a(4) = 140$\n$a = \\frac{140}{4}$\n$a = 35$\n\nNow substitute $a = 35$ into Equation 2:\n$300 + k = a^2$\n$300 + k = 35^2$\n$300 + k = 1225$\n$k = 1225 - 300$\n$k = 925$\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{925}$\n\nVerification:\nIf $k = 925$, then:\n$36 + k = 36 + 925 = 961 = 31^2$\n$300 + k = 300 + 925 = 1225 = 35^2$\n$596 + k = 596 + 925 = 1521 = 39^2$\nThe numbers $31, 35, 39$ form an arithmetic series with a common difference of $4$. Thus, the conditions are satisfied.",

          "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given that when an integer $k$ is added to each of the numbers 36, 300, and 596, the results are the squares of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series. Let's denote the first term of this arithmetic series as $a$, and the common difference as $d$. Therefore, the three terms are $a$, $a+d$, and $a+2d$.\n\n## Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information\nWhen $k$ is added to 36, 300, and 596, we get $a^2$, $(a+d)^2$, and $(a+2d)^2$ respectively. So, we have the following equations:\n1. $36 + k = a^2$\n2. $300 + k = (a+d)^2$\n3. $596 + k = (a+2d)^2$\n\n## Step 3: Expand the equations\nExpanding the second and third equations gives:\n1. $36 + k = a^2$\n2. $300 + k = a^2 + 2ad + d^2$\n3. $596 + k = a^2 + 4ad + 4d^2$\n\n## Step 4: Subtract the first equation from the second and third equations to eliminate $k$ and $a^2$\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n$300 + k - (36 + k) = a^2 + 2ad + d^2 - a^2$\nWhich simplifies to:\n$264 = 2ad + d^2$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the third gives:\n$596 + k - (36 + k) = a^2 + 4ad + 4d^2 - a^2$\nWhich simplifies to:\n$560 = 4ad + 4d^2$\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equations further\nFrom $264 = 2ad + d^2$, we can rewrite it as:\n$264 = d(2a + d)$\n\nFrom $560 = 4ad + 4d^2$, we can rewrite it as:\n$560 = 4d(a + d)$\nOr:\n$140 = d(a + d)$\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $d$ and $a$\nWe notice that $140 = d(a + d)$ can be related to $264 = d(2a + d)$ by realizing that $140 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 280$ and $264 = d(2a + d)$ can be seen as $2 \\cdot 132 = d(2a + d)$. Given the relationship between these two equations, let's divide the equation $264 = d(2a + d)$ by 2 to get $132 = d(a + \\frac{d}{2})$ and compare it with $140 = d(a + d)$.\n\nHowever, to directly solve for $d$ and $a$ using the simplified equations:\nWe can solve these equations by trial and error or by dividing one by the other to eliminate $d$ and solve for $a$ in terms of $d$.\n\nDividing $140 = d(a + d)$ by $132 = d(a + \\frac{d}{2})$ gives:\n$\\frac{140}{132} = \\frac{a + d}{a + \\frac{d}{2}}$\n\n## Step 7: Solve the division result for $a$ and $d$\nLet's simplify $\\frac{140}{132} = \\frac{a + d}{a + \\frac{d}{2}}$:\n$\\frac{140}{132} = \\frac{2a + 2d}{2a + d}$\nCross-multiplying gives:\n$140(2a + d) = 132(2a + 2d)$\nExpanding both sides gives:\n$280a + 140d = 264a + 264d$\nRearranging gives:\n$280a - 264a = 264d - 140d$\nWhich simplifies to:\n$16a = 124d$\nOr:\n$a = \\frac{124d}{16}$\n$a = \\frac{31d}{4}$\n\n## Step 8: Substitute $a$ back into one of the simplified equations to solve for $d$\nSubstituting $a = \\frac{31d}{4}$ into $140 = d(a + d)$ gives:\n$140 = d(\\frac{31d}{4} + d)$\n$140 = d(\\frac{31d + 4d}{4})$\n$140 = d(\\frac{35d}{4})$\n$140 = \\frac{35d^2}{4}$\nMultiplying both sides by 4 gives:\n$560 = 35d^2$\nDividing both sides by 35 gives:\n$16 = d^2$\nSo, $d = \\pm4$\n\n## Step 9: Solve for $a$ using $d = 4$\nUsing $d = 4$ (since $d$ should be positive in the context of this problem for the terms to be consecutive and increasing) and substituting into $a = \\frac{31d}{4}$ gives:\n$a = \\frac{31 \\cdot 4}{4}$\n$a = 31$\n\n## Step 10: Solve for $k$ using the first equation\nNow, substitute $a = 31$ into the first equation $36 + k = a^2$:\n$36 + k = 31^2$\n$36 + k = 961$\nSubtracting 36 from both sides gives:\n$k = 925$\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{925}$"

          "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nWe are given three numbers: 36, 300, and 596, and we need to find an integer k such that when added to each of these numbers, the resulting numbers are in a specific relationship or pattern, but the problem statement seems incomplete as it doesn't specify the relationship or pattern. However, typically, such problems might be looking for a relationship like forming an arithmetic sequence, geometric sequence, or another mathematical relationship.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the missing information\nSince the problem statement is incomplete, we'll assume a common scenario where the goal is to find a k that makes the three resulting numbers form an arithmetic sequence, which is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between any two successive members is constant.\n\n## Step 3: Set up equations based on the assumption\nLet's denote the three numbers after adding k as (36+k), (300+k), and (596+k). For these to form an arithmetic sequence, the differences between successive members must be equal. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (300+k) - (36+k) = (596+k) - (300+k).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 264 = 296. This simplification shows that our initial assumption about forming an arithmetic sequence might not directly apply or there was a misunderstanding in interpreting the problem due to its incomplete nature.\n\n## Step 5: Re-evaluate the approach\nGiven the incomplete problem statement, we must recognize that without a clear objective (like forming a specific sequence or achieving a certain property among the numbers), we cannot accurately solve for k. The typical approach would involve identifying the relationship or constraint that k must satisfy in relation to the numbers 36, 300, and 596.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$"

This allows us to rewrite the expression as $\\left(k - \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{9}{4} + 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression, we have $\\left(k - \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{9}{4} + 2 = \\left(k - \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{8}{4} = \\left(k - \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 5: Set the expression equal to a perfect square\nWe want $k^2 - 3k + 2$ to be a perfect square, so we set $\\left(k - \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{4} = m^2$, where $m$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 6: Rearrange the equation\nRearranging the equation, we get $\\left(k - \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = m^2 + \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 7: Express the equation in terms of $k$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have $k - \\frac{3}{2} = \\pm \\sqrt{m^2 + \\frac{1}{4}}$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $k$\nSolving for $k$, we get $k = \\frac{3}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{m^2 + \\frac{1}{4}}$.\n\n## Step 9: Find the smallest possible value of $k$\nTo find the smallest possible value of $k$, we need to find the smallest value of $m$ such that $k$ is an integer. Since $m$ is an integer, the smallest value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m = 0$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the value of $k$ for $m = 0$\nSubstituting $m = 0$ into the equation, we get $k = \\frac{3}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{0 + \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 11: Determine the possible values of $k$\nThis gives us two possible values for $k$: $k = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 2$ and $k = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 1$.\n\n## Step 12: Check if $k = 1$ satisfies the original condition\nSubstituting $k = 1$ into the original expression, we get $1^2 - 3(1) + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0$, which is a perfect square.\n\n## Step 13: Check if $k = 2$ satisfies the original condition\nSubstituting $k = 2$ into the original expression, we get $2^2 - 3(2) + 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0$, which is also a perfect square.\n\n## Step 14: Determine the smallest possible value of $k$\nSince both $k = 1$ and $k = 2$ satisfy the condition, the smallest possible value of $k$ is $1$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$"
