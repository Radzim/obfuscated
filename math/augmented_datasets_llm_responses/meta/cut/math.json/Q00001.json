Problem Statement**\n\nCompute the square root of the expression formed by the product of four consecutive integers starting from 28, plus one.\nIn mathematical terms, evaluate $\\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1}$.\n\nKey variables:\n- We are asked to compute the square root of an expression.\n- The expression is formed by the product of four consecutive integers: 28, 29, 30, and 31, plus 1.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will try to find a pattern by considering similar expressions with smaller consecutive integers. We hypothesize that the expression inside the square root is a perfect square. We will then generalize the pattern algebraically to derive a formula for the square root of the product of four consecutive integers plus one. Finally, we will apply this formula to the given problem.\n\nRelevant formulas/theorems:\n- Algebraic manipulation\n- Recognizing perfect square trinomials, i.e., $(a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nLet's denote the expression inside the square root as $E = (31)(30)(29)(28)+1$.\nWe can rearrange the terms to identify a pattern:\n$E = (31 \\times 28) \\times (30 \\times 29) + 1$\n$E = (30+1)(30-2) \\times (30)(30-1) + 1$\n$E = (30^2 - 2 \\times 30 + 30 - 2) \\times (30^2 - 30) + 1$\n$E = (30^2 - 30 - 2) \\times (30^2 - 30) + 1$\n\nLet $x = 30^2 - 30$. Then $E = (x-2)x + 1 = x^2 - 2x + 1$.\nWe recognize that $x^2 - 2x + 1$ is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as $(x-1)^2$.\nSo, $E = (x-1)^2 = (30^2 - 30 - 1)^2$.\nNow we substitute back $x = 30^2 - 30 = 900 - 30 = 870$.\n$E = (870 - 1)^2 = (869)^2$.\n\nTherefore, $\\sqrt{E} = \\sqrt{(869)^2} = |869|$.\nSince 869 is positive, $\\sqrt{E} = 869$.\n\nAlternatively, let's generalize for four consecutive integers $n, n+1, n+2, n+3$.\nConsider the product $P = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$.\nRearrange the terms: $P = [n(n+3)][(n+1)(n+2)] = (n^2+3n)(n^2+3n+2)$.\nLet $y = n^2+3n$. Then $P = y(y+2) = y^2+2y$.\nSo $P+1 = y^2+2y+1 = (y+1)^2 = (n^2+3n+1)^2$.\nThus, $\\sqrt{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)+1} = \\sqrt{(n^2+3n+1)^2} = |n^2+3n+1|$.\nIn our problem, the four consecutive integers are $28, 29, 30, 31$. Let $n=28$.\nThen $n^2+3n+1 = 28^2 + 3(28) + 1 = 784 + 84 + 1 = 869$.\n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n$28^2 = 784$\n$3 \\times 28 = 84$\n$784 + 84 + 1 = 869$\n\nWe can also use the middle numbers approach.\nLet the integers be $n-1, n, n+1, n+2$. Let $n=29$.\nThen the integers are $28, 29, 30, 31$.\n$(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)+1 = [n(n+1)][(n-1)(n+2)]+1 = (n^2+n)(n^2+n-2)+1$.\nLet $z = n^2+n$. Then $(z)(z-2)+1 = z^2-2z+1 = (z-1)^2 = (n^2+n-1)^2$.\nFor $n=29$, $n^2+n-1 = 29^2+29-1 = 841+29-1 = 841+28 = 869$.\n\nFinal verification:\n$869^2 = 755161$.\n$(31)(30)(29)(28)+1 = 31 \\times 30 \\times 29 \\times 28 + 1 = 930 \\times 29 \\times 28 + 1 = 26970 \\times 28 + 1 = 755160 + 1 = 755161$.\nThus, $\\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1} = \\sqrt{755161} = 869$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{869}$",

          "## Step 1: Recognize the given expression as a special case that can be simplified using the difference of squares identity.\nThe expression $\\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1}$ can be seen as $\\sqrt{(31 \\cdot 28) \\cdot (30 \\cdot 29) + 1}$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{(868)(870)+1}$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the difference of squares identity to simplify the expression.\nWe notice that $(870)^2 - (868)^2 = (870 + 868)(870 - 868) = 1740 \\cdot 2 = 3480$. However, to apply the difference of squares identity directly to our problem, we should look for a way to express the given expression in a form that resembles $(a^2 - b^2)$. But first, let's directly calculate the product inside the square root: $(31)(30)(29)(28) = 868 \\cdot 870$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression inside the square root using the calculated product.\nThe expression becomes $\\sqrt{868 \\cdot 870 + 1}$. Recognizing that $868 \\cdot 870$ is very close to $869^2$, let's calculate the exact value of $869^2$ and compare.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $869^2$ to compare with $868 \\cdot 870$.\n$869^2 = 869 \\cdot 869 = 755041$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $868 \\cdot 870$ to see how it compares to $869^2$.\n$868 \\cdot 870 = 755580$. However, we need to add 1 to this product, resulting in $755581$.\n\n## Step 6: Realize the mistake in comparing $868 \\cdot 870$ directly to $869^2$ and correct the approach by considering the actual calculation needed.\nWe should directly consider the expression $\\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1}$ as $\\sqrt{868 \\cdot 870 + 1}$ and recognize it can be simplified by understanding that $868 \\cdot 870$ is close to $869^2$, but the key insight is to use the formula $(a^2 - b^2) = (a - b)(a + b)$ in reverse, looking for a pattern that fits our numbers.\n\n## Step 7: Correctly apply a relevant algebraic identity to simplify the given expression.\nHowever, a more direct approach to simplify $\\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1}$ is to recognize it follows a pattern where $\\sqrt{n(n+1)(n-1)(n-2)+1}$ can be simplified using the identity $(n^2 - 1)(n^2 - 4) + 1 = (n^2 - 2)^2 - 3$, but this seems not directly applicable. Instead, consider the direct computation approach given the numbers are large and the expression does not easily simplify using standard identities without a clear $a^2 - b^2$ form.\n\n## Step 8: Directly compute the value inside the square root.\nGiven the numbers, directly compute $(31)(30)(29)(28)$ and then add 1 to get the value inside the square root.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the product of (31)(30)(29)(28).\n$(31)(30)(29)(28) = 31 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 28 = 755040$.\n\n## Step 10: Add 1 to the product to get the final value inside the square root.\n$755040 + 1 = 755041$.\n\n## Step 11: Take the square root of the final value inside the square root.\n$\\sqrt{755041} = 869$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{869}$"

However, the key insight is to recognize that this product can be seen as close to $29^2 \\times 30^2$ because $31 \\times 28 = 868$ is close to $30^2 = 900$ and $29 \\times 30 = 870$ is exactly between $29^2 = 841$ and $30^2 = 900$.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the insight to simplify\nHowever, the correct approach should directly utilize the given numbers without approximation.

The correct step involves recognizing that this expression simplifies to $\\sqrt{31 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 28}$.\n\n## Step 10: Final Calculation\nThe expression $\\sqrt{31 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 28}$ can be calculated directly or by recognizing patterns that simplify the calculation. However, the direct approach to find the square root of the product of these consecutive numbers is to calculate the product first and then find its square root.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{869}$"
