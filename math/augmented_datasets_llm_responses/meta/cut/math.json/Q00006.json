  "solution": "### Problem:\n1. **Problem Statement**\nFind the remainder when the polynomial $P(x) = 6x^3-15x^2+21x-23$ is divided by the polynomial $D(x) = 3x-6$.\nHere, the dividend is $P(x) = 6x^3-15x^2+21x-23$ and the divisor is $D(x) = 3x-6$. We need to find the remainder of the division.\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\nWe can solve this problem using two methods:\nMethod 1: Polynomial Remainder Theorem\nMethod 2: Polynomial Long Division\n\nMethod 1: Polynomial Remainder Theorem\nTo use the Polynomial Remainder Theorem, we need to find the value of $x$ that makes the divisor $3x-6$ equal to zero.\nSet $3x-6 = 0$, which gives $3x = 6$, so $x = 2$.\nAccording to the Polynomial Remainder Theorem, the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $x-c$ is $P(c)$. In our case, we consider the divisor to be effectively in the form of $x-2$ since $3x-6 = 3(x-2)$.  We evaluate $P(2)$ to find the remainder.\n\nMethod 2: Polynomial Long Division\nWe perform polynomial long division to divide $6x^3-15x^2+21x-23$ by $3x-6$. The remainder will be the constant term left after the division process.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Method 1: Polynomial Remainder Theorem**\n- Set the divisor $3x-6$ to zero and solve for $x$:\n  $3x-6 = 0$\n  $3x = 6$\n  $x = 2$\n\n- Substitute $x=2$ into the polynomial $P(x) = 6x^3-15x^2+21x-23$:\n  $P(2) = 6(2)^3 - 15(2)^2 + 21(2) - 23$\n  $P(2) = 6(8) - 15(4) + 42 - 23$\n  $P(2) = 48 - 60 + 42 - 23$\n  $P(2) = (48 + 42) - (60 + 23)$\n  $P(2) = 90 - 83$\n  $P(2) = 7$\n  Thus, the remainder is $7$.\n\n**Method 2: Polynomial Long Division**\n```\n        2x^2   -x    +5\n      ___________________\n3x-6 |  6x^3  -15x^2  +21x  -23\n      -(6x^3  -12x^2)\n      ___________________\n             -3x^2   +21x\n             -(-3x^2  +6x)\n             ___________________\n                    15x  -23\n                    -(15x  -30)\n                    ___________________\n                           7\n```\n- Divide the first term of the dividend ($6x^3$) by the first term of the divisor ($3x$) to get the first term of the quotient: $6x^3 / 3x = 2x^2$.\n- Multiply the divisor ($3x-6$) by $2x^2$ to get $2x^2(3x-6) = 6x^3 - 12x^2$.\n- Subtract this from the dividend: $(6x^3-15x^2+21x-23) - (6x^3 - 12x^2) = -3x^2 + 21x - 23$.\n- Divide the first term of the new dividend ($-3x^2$) by the first term of the divisor ($3x$) to get the next term of the quotient: $-3x^2 / 3x = -x$.\n- Multiply the divisor ($3x-6$) by $-x$ to get $-x(3x-6) = -3x^2 + 6x$.\n- Subtract this from the new dividend: $(-3x^2 + 21x - 23) - (-3x^2 + 6x) = 15x - 23$.\n- Divide the first term of the new dividend ($15x$) by the first term of the divisor ($3x$) to get the next term of the quotient: $15x / 3x = 5$.\n- Multiply the divisor ($3x-6$) by $5$ to get $5(3x-6) = 15x - 30$.\n- Subtract this from the new dividend: $(15x - 23) - (15x - 30) = 7$.\n- The remainder is $7$.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\nThe remainder when $6x^3-15x^2+21x-23$ is divided by $3x-6$ is $7$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{7}$",

In this case, the divisor is $3x - 6$, which we can rewrite as $3(x - 2)$.\n\n## Step 2: Since the divisor is equivalent to $3(x - 2)$, we can apply the remainder theorem by setting $x$ equal to the value that makes the divisor equal to zero.\nSetting $3x - 6 = 0$, we find $x = 2$. This is the value we will substitute into the polynomial $6x^3 - 15x^2 + 21x - 23$ to find the remainder.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute $x = 2$ into the polynomial $6x^3 - 15x^2 + 21x - 23$.\nCalculating $6(2)^3 - 15(2)^2 + 21(2) - 23$ gives us $6(8) - 15(4) + 42 - 23$.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the arithmetic to simplify the expression.\n$6(8) = 48$, $15(4) = 60$, so the expression simplifies to $48 - 60 + 42 - 23$.\n\n## Step 5: Continue simplifying the expression.\n$48 - 60 = -12$, then $-12 + 42 = 30$, and finally $30 - 23 = 7$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{7}$"

          "## Step 1: Identify the divisor\nThe problem statement is incomplete as it doesn't specify the divisor. However, based on common practices in algebra, a typical divisor to consider for remainder problems, especially when the divisor is not specified, could be a linear expression like $x - c$, where $c$ is a constant. Without a specified divisor, we can't directly compute the remainder. For the sake of providing a solution, let's assume the divisor is $x - 1$, a common choice for such problems.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Remainder Theorem\nThe Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial $f(x)$ by a divisor of the form $x - c$ is just $f(c)$. Therefore, if we are dividing by $x - 1$, we substitute $x = 1$ into the polynomial $6x^3 - 15x^2 + 21x - 23$ to find the remainder.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate $f(1)$\nSubstitute $x = 1$ into the polynomial:\n$f(1) = 6(1)^3 - 15(1)^2 + 21(1) - 23$\n$f(1) = 6(1) - 15(1) + 21(1) - 23$\n$f(1) = 6 - 15 + 21 - 23$\n$f(1) = -11$\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-11}$"

However, since the divisor is not explicitly given, we'll assume the problem is asking for the remainder when divided by a linear factor, which is a common approach in such problems.\nGiven the polynomial $6x^3-15x^2+21x-23$, we need more information to proceed directly with division. However, a common approach to find a remainder without a specific divisor is to use the Remainder Theorem, which states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial f(x) by a divisor of the form (x - c) is just f(c).\n\n## Step 2: Since we're not given a specific divisor, let's consider a general case where we might be looking for the remainder when divided by (x - c). Without a specific value for c, we cannot directly apply the Remainder Theorem to find a numerical answer.\nHowever, if we were to follow a typical application of the Remainder Theorem, we would substitute the value of c into the polynomial and solve for f(c), which would give us the remainder.\n\n## Step 3: Without a specific divisor or value for c, we cannot calculate a specific remainder. The problem as stated lacks necessary information for a direct calculation.\nIn a typical scenario, if we were given a divisor like (x - 1), we would substitute x = 1 into the polynomial: $6(1)^3 - 15(1)^2 + 21(1) - 23$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the remainder using x = 1 as an example.\n$6(1)^3 - 15(1)^2 + 21(1) - 23 = 6 - 15 + 21 - 23$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the arithmetic.\n$6 - 15 + 21 - 23 = -11$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-11}$"
