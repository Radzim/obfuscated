  "solution": "### Problem Statement\nLet $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $z$ be complex numbers such that $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$ and\n\\[az^2 + bz + c = 0.\\]\nWe need to find the largest possible value of $|z|.$\n\nKey variables: $a, b, c, z \\in \\mathbb{C}$\nConstraints: $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$, $az^2 + bz + c = 0$\n\n### Solution Strategy\nWe can simplify the equation by dividing by $a$ (since $a \\neq 0$). Let $B = b/a$ and $C = c/a$. Then the equation becomes $z^2 + Bz + C = 0$.\nFrom the given condition $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$, we have $|B| = |b/a| = |b|/|a| = 1$ and $|C| = |c/a| = |c|/|a| = 1$.\nWe use the quadratic formula to solve for $z$:\n\\[z = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}}{2}.\\]\nWe want to maximize $|z| = \\frac{|-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2} = \\frac{|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2}.$\nTo maximize $|z|$, we need to maximize $|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|.$\nUsing the triangle inequality, $|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| \\le |B| + |\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = 1 + \\sqrt{|B^2 - 4C|}.$\nTo maximize $|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|$, we need to maximize $|B^2 - 4C|.$\nBy the triangle inequality, $|B^2 - 4C| \\le |B^2| + |-4C| = |B|^2 + 4|C| = 1^2 + 4(1) = 5.$\nThe maximum value of $|B^2 - 4C|$ is achieved when $B^2$ and $-4C$ have the same argument.\nLet $B = 1$ (so $B^2 = 1$). To make $-4C$ have the same argument as $B^2 = 1$ (argument 0), we need $-4C$ to be a positive real number. Let $-4C = 4$, so $C = -1$. Then $|B| = |1| = 1$ and $|C| = |-1| = 1$.\nIn this case, $B^2 - 4C = 1 - 4(-1) = 5.$\nThen $\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C} = \\sqrt{5}.$\nWe choose the minus sign to maximize $|B - \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = |1 - \\sqrt{5}| = \\sqrt{5} - 1.$\nWe choose the plus sign to maximize $|B + \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = |1 + \\sqrt{5}| = 1 + \\sqrt{5}.$\nThe larger value is $1 + \\sqrt{5}.$\nThen the maximum value of $|z| = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Divide by $a$**: Since $a \\neq 0,$ we divide the equation $az^2 + bz + c = 0$ by $a$ to get $z^2 + \\frac{b}{a}z + \\frac{c}{a} = 0.$\n2. **Substitute $B = b/a$ and $C = c/a$**: Let $B = \\frac{b}{a}$ and $C = \\frac{c}{a}.$ Then the equation becomes $z^2 + Bz + C = 0.$\n3. **Determine magnitudes of $B$ and $C$**: Since $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0,$ we have $|B| = |\\frac{b}{a}| = \\frac{|b|}{|a|} = 1$ and $|C| = |\\frac{c}{a}| = \\frac{|c|}{|a|} = 1.$\n4. **Apply the quadratic formula**: The solutions for $z$ are given by $z = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}}{2}.$\n5. **Maximize $|z|$**: We want to maximize $|z| = \\frac{|-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2} = \\frac{|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2}.$ To maximize $|z|,$ we need to maximize $|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|.$\n6. **Maximize $|\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|$**: We have $|\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = \\sqrt{|B^2 - 4C|}.$ By triangle inequality, $|B^2 - 4C| \\le |B^2| + |4C| = |B|^2 + 4|C| = 1^2 + 4(1) = 5.$ The maximum value of $|B^2 - 4C|$ is $5.$ This is achieved when $B^2$ and $-4C$ have the same argument.\n7. **Choose $B$ and $C$ to achieve maximum $|B^2 - 4C|$**: Let $B = 1,$ then $B^2 = 1.$ To make $-4C$ have the same argument as $B^2 = 1,$ we choose $-4C = 4,$ so $C = -1.$ Then $|B| = 1$ and $|C| = 1,$ which satisfy the conditions.\n8. **Calculate $z$ with chosen $B$ and $C$**: With $B = 1$ and $C = -1,$ $z = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(-1)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n9. **Find the largest $|z|$**: We have two solutions $z_1 = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $z_2 = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n$|z_1| = |\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}| = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}.$\n$|z_2| = |\\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}| = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\nThe largest value is $|z_2| = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}$",

          "## Step 1: Understand the given conditions\nWe are given that $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$ and the equation $az^2 + bz + c = 0$. We need to find the value of $z$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the properties of complex numbers\nFor a complex number $z$, $|z|$ represents the modulus or absolute value of $z$. Given $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$, it means $a$, $b$, and $c$ have the same magnitude but can differ in direction or argument.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the given equation\nThe equation $az^2 + bz + c = 0$ is a quadratic equation in terms of $z$. To solve for $z$, we can use the quadratic formula, which states that for an equation of the form $az^2 + bz + c = 0$, the solutions are given by $z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the quadratic formula\nSubstituting $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the quadratic formula, we get $z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. However, we need to consider the given condition $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$ and how it affects the solution.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the condition $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$\nGiven that $|a| = |b| = |c|$, let's denote this common magnitude as $r$. Thus, $|a| = |b| = |c| = r$. This condition implies that $a$, $b$, and $c$ lie on a circle with radius $r$ in the complex plane.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation with $|a| = |b| = |c| = r$\nSince $|a| = |b| = |c| = r$, we can express $a$, $b$, and $c$ as $a = re^{i\\theta_1}$, $b = re^{i\\theta_2}$, and $c = re^{i\\theta_3}$, where $\\theta_1$, $\\theta_2$, and $\\theta_3$ are the arguments of $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute $a = re^{i\\theta_1}$, $b = re^{i\\theta_2}$, and $c = re^{i\\theta_3}$ into the equation\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation $az^2 + bz + c = 0$, we get $re^{i\\theta_1}z^2 + re^{i\\theta_2}z + re^{i\\theta_3} = 0$. Factoring out $r$, we have $r(e^{i\\theta_1}z^2 + e^{i\\theta_2}z + e^{i\\theta_3}) = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $z$\nSince $r > 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $r$, resulting in $e^{i\\theta_1}z^2 + e^{i\\theta_2}z + e^{i\\theta_3} = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $z$, and its solutions can be found using the quadratic formula.\n\n## Step 9: Apply the quadratic formula to the modified equation\nThe solutions for $z$ are given by $z = \\frac{-e^{i\\theta_2} \\pm \\sqrt{e^{i\\theta_2}^2 - 4e^{i\\theta_1}e^{i\\theta_3}}}{2e^{i\\theta_1}}$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the expression under the square root\nThe expression under the square root can be simplified as $e^{i\\theta_2}^2 - 4e^{i\\theta_1}e^{i\\theta_3} = e^{i2\\theta_2} - 4e^{i(\\theta_1 + \\theta_3)}$.\n\n## Step 11: Consider the magnitude of the solutions\nSince $|a| = |b| = |c| = r$, the magnitude of the solutions $z$ should be such that $|z| = 1$ because the equation represents a balance between $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\n## Step 12: Recall Vieta's formulas for quadratic equations\nFor a quadratic equation $az^2 + bz + c = 0$, the sum of the roots $z_1$ and $z_2$ is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$.\n\n## Step 13: Apply Vieta's formulas to the given equation\nGiven $az^2 + bz + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$. Since $|a| = |b| = |c| = r$, we have $|c/a| = |r/r| = 1$.\n\n## Step 14: Conclude on the value of $z$\nConsidering the product of the roots is $c/a$ and $|c/a| = 1$, it implies that $|z_1z_2| = 1$. For a quadratic equation with complex coefficients, if the product of the roots is 1, the roots are reciprocals of each other.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$"

The smallest $r$ can be, given $|a + b + c| = 1$, is when $a$, $b$, and $c$ are equally spaced around the origin and $|a + b + c|$ is minimized, which due to symmetry and the nature of complex numbers, suggests $r = \\frac{1}{3}$ does not directly follow from the equality condition but from the constraint on $|z|$ and the properties of complex numbers.\n\n## Step 6: Final consideration of $|z| = 1$\nGiven $|z| = |a + b + c| = 1$ and $|a| = |b| = |c| = r$, to achieve the smallest $r$ satisfying these conditions, we consider the geometric interpretation and the fact that $|a + b + c|$ is maximized when $a$, $b$, and $c$ are in the same direction, but here we are constrained by $|z| = 1$. The condition $r \\ge \\frac{1}{3}$ is derived from the necessity for $|a + b + c|$ to be at most $3r$ (by the Triangle Inequality), and since $|a + b + c| = 1$, $3r \\ge 1$ or $r \\ge \\frac{1}{3}$. However, achieving $r = \\frac{1}{3}$ exactly under the given constraints requires $a$, $b$, and $c$ to be arranged such that their sum equals $1$ in magnitude, which is possible if they are $\\frac{1}{3}$ in magnitude and appropriately directed.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$"

          "## Step 1: Understand the given conditions\nWe are given that $|a| = |b| = |c| = |z| = 1$, which means all these complex numbers lie on the unit circle in the complex plane.\n\n## Step 2: Recall properties of complex numbers on the unit circle\nFor any complex number $w$ on the unit circle, we have $|w| = 1$, which implies $w \\cdot \\overline{w} = |w|^2 = 1$, where $\\overline{w}$ is the complex conjugate of $w$. This means $\\overline{w} = \\frac{1}{w}$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the given equation\nGiven $az + b + c = 0$, we want to find $z$. Rearranging the equation gives $az = -b - c$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $z$\nDividing both sides by $a$ gives $z = -\\frac{b + c}{a}$. Since $|a| = 1$, we can also express $a$ as $a = \\overline{a}$ because for a complex number on the unit circle, its conjugate is its reciprocal.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the modulus of $z$\nTo find $|z|$, we use the fact that $|z| = \\left|-\\frac{b + c}{a}\\right| = \\frac{|b + c|}{|a|}$. Since $|a| = 1$, $|z| = |b + c|$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the Triangle Inequality\nThe Triangle Inequality states that for any complex numbers $x$ and $y$, $|x + y| \\leq |x| + |y|$. Applying this to $b + c$, we get $|b + c| \\leq |b| + |c|$.\n\n## Step 7: Use given information about $b$ and $c$\nSince $|b| = |c| = 1$, $|b + c| \\leq 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the maximum value of $|z|$\nFrom step 5, $|z| = |b + c|$, and from step 7, $|b + c| \\leq 2$. Therefore, the maximum value of $|z|$ is achieved when $b + c$ is aligned (in the same direction), giving $|z| \\leq 2$.\n\n## Step 9: Equality condition\nEquality in the Triangle Inequality $|b + c| \\leq |b| + |c|$ occurs if and only if $b$ and $c$ have the same argument (are in the same direction). For $|z|$ to be maximized, $b$ and $c$ must be aligned.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$"
