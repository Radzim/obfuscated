  "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nFind the number of complex numbers $z$ that satisfy both of the following conditions:\n- The modulus of $z$ is 5, i.e., $|z| = 5$.\n- Applying the function $f(z) = i\\overline{z}$ to $z$ results in $z$ itself, i.e., $f(z) = z$.\n\nHere, $i$ is the imaginary unit ($i^2 = -1$) and $\\overline{z}$ is the complex conjugate of $z$. We need to determine how many such values of $z$ exist.\n\n**Key variables and constraints:**\n- $z$: Complex number, $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$\n- $|z| = 5$: Modulus of $z$ is 5\n- $f(z) = i\\overline{z}$: Definition of the function $f$\n- $f(z) = z$: Condition for $z$ to be a fixed point of $f$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will first use the condition $f(z) = z$ to find a general form for $z$. Then we will use the condition $|z| = 5$ to further restrict the possible values of $z$ and count the number of solutions.\n\nWe will use the representation of a complex number $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, and its conjugate $\\overline{z} = x - yi$. The modulus of $z$ is given by $|z| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.\n\n**Relevant formulas/theorems:**\n- Complex number representation: $z = x + yi$, $\\overline{z} = x - yi$\n- Modulus of a complex number: $|z| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$\n- Condition $f(z) = z$: $i\\overline{z} = z$\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nLet $z = x + yi$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThen $\\overline{z} = x - yi$.\nThe condition $f(z) = z$ is given by $i\\overline{z} = z$.\nSubstituting $\\overline{z} = x - yi$ and $z = x + yi$ into the equation, we get:\n$i(x - yi) = x + yi$\nExpanding the left side:\n$ix - i(yi) = x + yi$\n$ix - yi^2 = x + yi$\nSince $i^2 = -1$:\n$ix - y(-1) = x + yi$\n$ix + y = x + yi$\n\nFor two complex numbers to be equal, their real parts must be equal and their imaginary parts must be equal. Equating the real and imaginary parts of the equation $ix + y = x + yi$:\nReal parts: $y = x$\nImaginary parts: $x = y$\n\nBoth conditions are the same: $x = y$.\nSo, any complex number $z$ that satisfies $f(z) = z$ must be of the form $z = x + xi$, where $x$ is a real number.\n\nNow we apply the second condition, $|z| = 5$.\nFor $z = x + xi$, the modulus is:\n$|z| = |x + xi| = \\sqrt{x^2 + x^2} = \\sqrt{2x^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{x^2} = \\sqrt{2} |x|$.\nWe are given $|z| = 5$, so we have:\n$\\sqrt{2} |x| = 5$\n$|x| = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n\nThis means $x$ can take two possible values:\n$x = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ or $x = -\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\nFor each value of $x$, we have a corresponding value of $z = x + xi$.\nCase 1: $x = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Then $z_1 = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}i$.\nCase 2: $x = -\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Then $z_2 = -\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}i$.\n\nWe have found two values of $z$ that satisfy both conditions. Let's verify them.\nFor $z_1 = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}i$:\n$|z_1| = \\sqrt{(\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 + (\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{50}{4} + \\frac{50}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100}{4}} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$.\n$f(z_1) = i\\overline{z_1} = i(\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}i) = i\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} - i^2\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}i + \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}i = z_1$.\n\nFor $z_2 = -\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}i$:\n$|z_2| = \\sqrt{(-\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 + (-\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{50}{4} + \\frac{50}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100}{4}} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$.\n$f(z_2) = i\\overline{z_2} = i(-\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} - (-\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2})i) = i(-\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}i) = -i\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i^2\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}i - \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}i = z_2$.\n\nBoth $z_1$ and $z_2$ satisfy both conditions. Since there are exactly two possible values for $x$, there are exactly two values for $z$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",

The complex conjugate of $z$ is $\\overline{z} = x - yi$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the function $f(z)$ to $z$\nGiven $f(z) = i\\overline{z}$, substituting $\\overline{z}$ gives $f(z) = i(x - yi) = ix + y$.\n\n## Step 4: Equate $f(z)$ to $z$ as per the condition $f(z) = z$\nSetting $f(z) = z$, we have $ix + y = x + yi$. This implies $ix = x$ and $y = yi$, or after simplification, $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ does not necessarily follow from these equations.
