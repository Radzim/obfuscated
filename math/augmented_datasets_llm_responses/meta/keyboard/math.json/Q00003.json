So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n        $(x^2 - 10x + 25) - 50y^2 = 0$\n        The first three terms form a perfect square: $(x - 5)^2$.\n        So the equation becomes:\n        $(x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0$\n        This equation is in the form $X^2 - Y^2 = 0$, where $X = (x - 5)$ and $Y = \\sqrt{50}y$.\n        We can factor this equation as a difference of squares:\n        $[(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y][(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y] = 0$\n        This means either $(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y = 0$ or $(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y = 0$.\n        These are the equations of two lines:\n        Line 1: $(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y = 0 \\implies \\sqrt{50}y = (x - 5) \\implies y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}}(x - 5) = \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2}}(x - 5) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}(x - 5)$\n        Line 2: $(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y = 0 \\implies -\\sqrt{50}y = (x - 5) \\implies y = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}}(x - 5) = -\\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2}}(x - 5) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}(x - 5)$\n        These are two distinct lines passing through the point $(5, 0)$ with slopes $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}$ and $-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}$.\n        Therefore, the graph of the equation is two lines.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Final Answer}\n        \\boxed{\\text{two lines}}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n```",

          "## Step 1: Identify the equation and start simplifying\nThe given equation is $x^2 - 50y^2 - 10x + 25 = 0$. To simplify, let's rearrange and complete the square for the $x$ terms.\n\n## Step 2: Rearrange the equation\nRearrange the equation to group $x$ terms and constants: $x^2 - 10x - 50y^2 = -25$.\n\n## Step 3: Complete the square for $x$\nTo complete the square for $x^2 - 10x$, we add $(10/2)^2 = 25$ to both sides of the equation: $x^2 - 10x + 25 - 50y^2 = -25 + 25$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation after completing the square\nThis simplifies to: $(x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Factor the equation if possible\nThe equation can be factored as a difference of squares: $(x - 5)^2 - (\\sqrt{50}y)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $(x - 5 - \\sqrt{50}y)(x - 5 + \\sqrt{50}y) = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives two equations: $x - 5 - \\sqrt{50}y = 0$ and $x - 5 + \\sqrt{50}y = 0$. Solving these for $x$ gives $x = 5 + \\sqrt{50}y$ and $x = 5 - \\sqrt{50}y$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify $\\sqrt{50}$\nSince $\\sqrt{50} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 2} = 5\\sqrt{2}$, the solutions can be written as $x = 5 + 5\\sqrt{2}y$ and $x = 5 - 5\\sqrt{2}y$.\n\n## Step 8: Recognize the form of the solution\nThese equations represent lines in the form $x = my + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"
