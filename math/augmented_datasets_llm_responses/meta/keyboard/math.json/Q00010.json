  "solution": "## Solution:\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nWe are asked to find the remainder when the polynomial $P(x) = 2x^4+11x^3-42x^2-60x+47$ is divided by the polynomial $D(x) = x^2+7x-5$.\nLet $P(x)$ be the dividend and $D(x)$ be the divisor. We need to find the remainder $R(x)$ in the division $P(x) \\div D(x)$.\nThe degree of $P(x)$ is 4 and the degree of $D(x)$ is 2.\nThe degree of the remainder $R(x)$ must be less than the degree of the divisor $D(x)$. Thus, the degree of $R(x)$ is at most 1. We can express the remainder in the form $R(x) = ax+b$.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use polynomial long division to find the quotient and the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $D(x)$.\nThe process involves repeatedly dividing the leading term of the current dividend by the leading term of the divisor, multiplying the result by the divisor, and subtracting it from the current dividend. We continue this process until the degree of the remaining polynomial is less than the degree of the divisor.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nWe perform polynomial long division:\n```\n        2x^2  -3x   -11\n      ___________________\nx^2+7x-5 | 2x^4 +11x^3 -42x^2 -60x  +47\n        -(2x^4 +14x^3 -10x^2)\n        ___________________\n              -3x^3 -32x^2 -60x\n             -(-3x^3 -21x^2 +15x)\n             ___________________\n                    -11x^2 -75x  +47\n                   -(-11x^2 -77x  +55)\n                   ___________________\n                           2x   -8\n```\n\n**Step 1:** Divide $2x^4$ by $x^2$ to get $2x^2$. Multiply $2x^2$ by $x^2+7x-5$ to get $2x^4+14x^3-10x^2$. Subtract this from the dividend:\n$(2x^4+11x^3-42x^2-60x+47) - (2x^4+14x^3-10x^2) = -3x^3-32x^2-60x+47$.\n\n**Step 2:** Divide $-3x^3$ by $x^2$ to get $-3x$. Multiply $-3x$ by $x^2+7x-5$ to get $-3x^3-21x^2+15x$. Subtract this from the result of Step 1:\n$(-3x^3-32x^2-60x+47) - (-3x^3-21x^2+15x) = -11x^2-75x+47$.\n\n**Step 3:** Divide $-11x^2$ by $x^2$ to get $-11$. Multiply $-11$ by $x^2+7x-5$ to get $-11x^2-77x+55$. Subtract this from the result of Step 2:\n$(-11x^2-75x+47) - (-11x^2-77x+55) = 2x-8$.\n\nThe degree of $2x-8$ is 1, which is less than the degree of $x^2+7x-5$. Thus, the remainder is $R(x) = 2x-8$.\nThe quotient is $Q(x) = 2x^2-3x-11$.\n\nWe can verify this by checking if $P(x) = Q(x)D(x) + R(x)$:\n$(2x^2-3x-11)(x^2+7x-5) + (2x-8)$\n$= 2x^2(x^2+7x-5) -3x(x^2+7x-5) -11(x^2+7x-5) + (2x-8)$\n$= (2x^4+14x^3-10x^2) + (-3x^3-21x^2+15x) + (-11x^2-77x+55) + (2x-8)$\n$= 2x^4 + (14x^3-3x^3) + (-10x^2-21x^2-11x^2) + (15x-77x+2x) + (55-8)$\n$= 2x^4 + 11x^3 - 42x^2 - 60x + 47$\nThis matches the original polynomial $P(x)$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe remainder when $x^2+7x-5$ divides $2x^4+11x^3-42x^2-60x+47$ is $2x-8$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2x-8}$",

Let's attempt to factor them:\n\n1. $x^2 + 7x - 5$ can be factored using the quadratic formula since it doesn't factor easily: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. For $x^2 + 7x - 5 = 0$, $a = 1$, $b = 7$, $c = -5$. Thus, $x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{7^2 - 4(1)(-5)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 20}}{2} = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{69}}{2}$. This doesn't factor into simple roots.\n\n2. $2x^4 + 11x^3 - 42x^2 - 60x + 47$ is a quartic equation and is even more complex to factor directly without a hint or specific method.\n\nGiven the incomplete or unclear nature of the problem statement, it seems we're missing crucial information on how to proceed (e.g., are we to divide, multiply, or find the GCF of these two expressions?). \n\nAssuming the goal was to simplify or operate on these expressions in a manner not fully specified, and without further instructions or clarification, providing a precise numerical answer isn't feasible.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$"

          "## Step 1: Identify the given problem\nThe problem asks us to solve for the value of $x$ in the equation $x^2 + 7x - 5 = 2x^4 + 11x^3 - 42x^2 - 60x + 47$.\n\n## Step 2: Rearrange the equation\nTo solve for $x$, we first need to set the equation to zero. So, we rearrange the equation: $2x^4 + 11x^3 - 42x^2 - 60x + 47 - (x^2 + 7x - 5) = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying, we get $2x^4 + 11x^3 - 43x^2 - 67x + 52 = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the polynomial equation\nThis is a fourth-degree polynomial equation, which can be challenging to solve directly. Let's attempt to factor it or use a known method for solving quartic equations.\n\n## Step 5: Factor the polynomial\nAfter examination, we find that the polynomial can be factored as $(x-1)(2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x - 52) = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Further factorization\nWe notice that $x = 1$ is a root. The cubic equation $2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x - 52$ can be further factored or solved using the Rational Root Theorem or synthetic division.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the cubic equation\nUsing synthetic division or inspection, we find that $x = 2$ is a root of the cubic equation, leading to the factorization $2(x-2)(x^2 + 15x + 26) = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the quadratic equation\nThe quadratic $x^2 + 15x + 26$ can be factored or solved using the quadratic formula. Factoring seems challenging, so we use the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = 15$, and $c = 26$.\n\n## Step 9: Apply the quadratic formula\nSubstituting the values into the quadratic formula gives $x = \\frac{-15 \\pm \\sqrt{15^2 - 4*1*26}}{2*1}$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the discriminant\nThe discriminant $D = 15^2 - 4*1*26 = 225 - 104 = 121$.\n\n## Step 11: Solve for x\nThus, $x = \\frac{-15 \\pm \\sqrt{121}}{2} = \\frac{-15 \\pm 11}{2}$. This gives two solutions: $x = \\frac{-15 + 11}{2} = -2$ and $x = \\frac{-15 - 11}{2} = -13$.\n\n## Step 12: Compile all solutions\nCombining all steps, the solutions to the equation are $x = 1$, $x = 2$, $x = -2$, and $x = -13$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$"
