  "solution": "## Solution\n\n1. **Problem Statement**\nSolve the equation\n\\[\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{x}}} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + \\sqrt{x}}.\\]\nThe variable is $x$. We need to find the value(s) of $x$ that satisfy this equation. We must have $x \\ge 0$ for $\\sqrt{x}$ to be defined in real numbers. Also, for the nested square roots to be defined, we need $2 + \\sqrt{x} \\ge 0$, which is always true for $x \\ge 0$. And $1 + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{x}} \\ge 0$, which is also always true. For the cube root, $1 + \\sqrt{x}$ can be any non-negative value.\n\n2. **Solution Strategy**\nLet $y = \\sqrt{x}$. Then $y \\ge 0$ and $x = y^2$. Substituting $y$ into the equation, we get\n\\[\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + y}} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + y}.\\]\nTo eliminate the radicals, we raise both sides to the power of 6 (the least common multiple of 2 and 3):\n\\[(\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + y}})^6 = (\\sqrt[3]{1 + y})^6\\]\n\\[(1 + \\sqrt{2 + y})^3 = (1 + y)^2\\]\nExpand both sides and simplify to obtain a polynomial equation in terms of $y$. Solve for $y$ and then find $x = y^2$. Finally, we need to verify the solution in the original equation.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\nLet $y = \\sqrt{x}$. The equation becomes\n\\[\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + y}} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + y}.\\]\nRaise both sides to the power of 6:\n\\[(1 + \\sqrt{2 + y})^3 = (1 + y)^2\\]\nExpand the left side using the binomial expansion $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$ with $a = 1$ and $b = \\sqrt{2 + y}$:\n\\[1^3 + 3 \\cdot 1^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2 + y} + 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2 + y})^2 + (\\sqrt{2 + y})^3 = (1 + y)^2\\]\n\\[1 + 3\\sqrt{2 + y} + 3(2 + y) + (2 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = (1 + y)^2\\]\n\\[1 + 3\\sqrt{2 + y} + 6 + 3y + (2 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = 1 + 2y + y^2\\]\nCombine the terms without square roots:\n\\[7 + 3y + (3 + 2 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = 1 + 2y + y^2\\]\n\\[7 + 3y + (5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = 1 + 2y + y^2\\]\nIsolate the term with the square root:\n\\[(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = 1 + 2y + y^2 - 7 - 3y\\]\n\\[(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = y^2 - y - 6\\]\nFactor the quadratic expression on the right side:\n\\[(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = (y - 3)(y + 2)\\]\nSquare both sides to remove the square root:\n\\[(5 + y)^2 (2 + y) = (y - 3)^2 (y + 2)^2\\]\nSince we are looking for $y \\ge 0$, we know that $y + 2 \\ne 0$. If $y > -2$, we can divide both sides by $(y + 2)$:\n\\[(5 + y)^2 = (y - 3)^2 (y + 2)\\]\nExpand both sides:\n\\[25 + 10y + y^2 = (y^2 - 6y + 9)(y + 2)\\]\n\\[25 + 10y + y^2 = y^3 + 2y^2 - 6y^2 - 12y + 9y + 18\\]\n\\[25 + 10y + y^2 = y^3 - 4y^2 - 3y + 18\\]\nRearrange to form a cubic equation:\n\\[y^3 - 4y^2 - 3y + 18 - y^2 - 10y - 25 = 0\\]\n\\[y^3 - 5y^2 - 13y - 7 = 0\\]\nWe test integer roots that are divisors of $-7$, which are $\\pm 1, \\pm 7$.\nFor $y = 7$: $7^3 - 5(7^2) - 13(7) - 7 = 343 - 5(49) - 91 - 7 = 343 - 245 - 91 - 7 = 343 - 343 = 0$.\nSo $y = 7$ is a root. Thus $(y - 7)$ is a factor. We perform polynomial division or synthetic division to find the other factor.\nDividing $y^3 - 5y^2 - 13y - 7$ by $(y - 7)$:\n\\[y^3 - 5y^2 - 13y - 7 = (y - 7)(y^2 + 2y + 1)\\]\nThe quadratic factor is $y^2 + 2y + 1 = (y + 1)^2$.\nSo the equation becomes $(y - 7)(y + 1)^2 = 0$.\nThe roots are $y = 7$ and $y = -1$ (double root).\nSince $y = \\sqrt{x} \\ge 0$, we must have $y = 7$.\nThen $\\sqrt{x} = 7$, so $x = 7^2 = 49$.\n\nWe need to check if $x = 49$ is a solution to the original equation.\nLHS = $\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{49}}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + 7}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{9}} = \\sqrt{1 + 3} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nRHS = $\\sqrt[3]{1 + \\sqrt{49}} = \\sqrt[3]{1 + 7} = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$.\nLHS = RHS.\nSo $x = 49$ is a valid solution.\n\nWe should also check if $y = -1$ leads to any issues when squaring.\nFor $y = -1$, LHS of $(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = (5 - 1)\\sqrt{2 - 1} = 4\\sqrt{1} = 4$.\nRHS of $(y - 3)(y + 2) = (-1 - 3)(-1 + 2) = (-4)(1) = -4$.\nLHS $\\ne$ RHS.\nSo $y = -1$ is not a solution to $(5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = (y - 3)(y + 2)$.\nTherefore, $y = -1$ is an extraneous root introduced by squaring.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{49}$",

The correct approach should directly address the equation without incorrect expansion.\n\n## Step 5: Correct the approach by directly addressing the equation\nThe correct step after substitution is to raise both sides to the power of 3: \\((\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + y}})^3 = (1 + y)\\), which simplifies to \\(1 + \\sqrt{2 + y} + \\sqrt{(1 + \\sqrt{2 + y})(2 + y)} \\neq 1 + y\\). The mistake was in the expansion. The correct approach should involve squaring both sides after the initial substitution to simplify the equation before raising to the power of 3.\n\n## Step 6: Correctly simplify the equation\nLet's correct the process: Square both sides of the original equation after substitution, \\((\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2 + y}})^2 = (\\sqrt[3]{1 + y})^2\\), which gives \\(1 + \\sqrt{2 + y} = (1 + y)^{2/3}\\).\n\n## Step 7: Raise both sides to the power of 3 to eliminate the cube root\n\\((1 + \\sqrt{2 + y})^3 = 1 + y\\).\n\n## Step 8: Correctly expand and simplify\nExpanding correctly: \\(1 + 3\\sqrt{2 + y} + 3(2 + y) + (2 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = 1 + y\\), simplifying yields \\(3\\sqrt{2 + y} + 3(2 + y) + (2 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = y\\).\n\n## Step 9: Further simplification and solving for y\nThis simplifies to \\(3\\sqrt{2 + y} + (2 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = y - 6 - 3y\\), which further simplifies to \\((5 + y)\\sqrt{2 + y} = -4y - 6\\).\n\n## Step 10: Square both sides to solve for y\nSquaring both sides gives \\((5 + y)^2(2 + y) = (-4y - 6)^2\\), which expands to \\((25 + 10y + y^2)(2 + y) = 16y^2 + 48y + 36\\).\n\n## Step 11: Expand and simplify the equation\nExpanding yields \\(50 + 25y + 10y^2 + 2y^2 + 10y + y^3 = 16y^2 + 48y + 36\\), simplifying to \\(y^3 + 12y^2 - 13y + 14 = 0\\).\n\n## Step 12: Solve the cubic equation for y\nThis cubic equation needs to be solved for \\(y\\).

          "To solve the given equation, we first need to simplify and identify the variables and constants.\n\nGiven equation:\n\\[e9ICR \\ [\\ Qw%r {1 + \\ Zw#G {2 + \\ XWEY {x} }} = \\ EWD6 [3] {1 + \\ aat4 {x} }. \\]\n\nThis equation appears to be written in a symbolic or encoded form, with various letters and symbols that don't directly correspond to standard mathematical notation. However, to proceed, let's attempt to interpret it in a way that makes mathematical sense, assuming that the letters represent constants or functions and \"x\" is the variable.\n\nLet's simplify the equation by replacing the symbolic expressions with more standard mathematical notation, assuming that each unique set of letters represents a distinct constant or function:\n\nLet \\(e9ICR = A\\), \\(Qw%r = B\\), \\(Zw#G = C\\), \\(XWEY = D\\), \\(EWD6 = E\\), and \\(aat4 = F\\).\n\nThe equation then becomes:\n\\[A \\cdot B(1 + C(2 + Dx)) = E[3](1 + Fx)\\]\n\nTo further simplify, let's assume \\(E[3]\\) is a constant \\(G\\), so we have:\n\\[A \\cdot B(1 + C(2 + Dx)) = G(1 + Fx)\\]\n\nExpanding both sides gives:\n\\[AB + ABC(2 + Dx) = G + GFx\\]\n\\[AB + 2ABC + ABCDx = G + GFx\\]\n\nLet's group terms involving \\(x\\) and constants on opposite sides:\n\\[ABCDx - GFx = G - AB - 2ABC\\]\n\nFactor out \\(x\\) and simplify:\n\\[x(ABCD - GF) = G - AB - 2ABC\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[x = \\frac{G - AB - 2ABC}{ABCD - GF}\\]\n\nThis equation provides a solution for \\(x\\) in terms of the constants \\(A, B, C, D, E, F,\\) and \\(G\\). However, without specific values for these constants, we cannot provide a numerical solution for \\(x\\).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{x = \\frac{G - AB - 2ABC}{ABCD - GF}}$"

          "To solve the given equation, we first need to simplify and identify the variables and constants involved.

But without a clear definition of the functions or operations represented by the letters and symbols, any attempt at a solution would be speculative.\n\nGiven the information and the format of the equation, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a need for further clarification on the equation's components and how they relate to each other mathematically.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$"
