  "solution": "### Problem Statement\nLet $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $z$ be complex numbers such that $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$ and\n\\[az^2 + bz + c = 0.\\]\nWe need to find the largest possible value of $|z|.$\n\nKey variables: $a, b, c, z \\in \\mathbb{C}$\nConstraints: $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$, $az^2 + bz + c = 0$\n\n### Solution Strategy\nWe can simplify the equation by dividing by $a$ (since $a \\neq 0$). Let $B = b/a$ and $C = c/a$. Then the equation becomes $z^2 + Bz + C = 0$.\nFrom the given condition $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$, we have $|B| = |b/a| = |b|/|a| = 1$ and $|C| = |c/a| = |c|/|a| = 1$.\nWe use the quadratic formula to solve for $z$:\n\\[z = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}}{2}.\\]\nWe want to maximize $|z| = \\frac{|-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2} = \\frac{|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2}.$\nTo maximize $|z|$, we need to maximize $|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|.$\nUsing the triangle inequality, $|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| \\le |B| + |\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = 1 + \\sqrt{|B^2 - 4C|}.$\nTo maximize $|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|$, we need to maximize $|B^2 - 4C|.$\nBy the triangle inequality, $|B^2 - 4C| \\le |B^2| + |-4C| = |B|^2 + 4|C| = 1^2 + 4(1) = 5.$\nThe maximum value of $|B^2 - 4C|$ is achieved when $B^2$ and $-4C$ have the same argument.\nLet $B = 1$ (so $B^2 = 1$). To make $-4C$ have the same argument as $B^2 = 1$ (argument 0), we need $-4C$ to be a positive real number. Let $-4C = 4$, so $C = -1$. Then $|B| = |1| = 1$ and $|C| = |-1| = 1$.\nIn this case, $B^2 - 4C = 1 - 4(-1) = 5.$\nThen $\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C} = \\sqrt{5}.$\nWe choose the minus sign to maximize $|B - \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = |1 - \\sqrt{5}| = \\sqrt{5} - 1.$\nWe choose the plus sign to maximize $|B + \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = |1 + \\sqrt{5}| = 1 + \\sqrt{5}.$\nThe larger value is $1 + \\sqrt{5}.$\nThen the maximum value of $|z| = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Divide by $a$**: Since $a \\neq 0,$ we divide the equation $az^2 + bz + c = 0$ by $a$ to get $z^2 + \\frac{b}{a}z + \\frac{c}{a} = 0.$\n2. **Substitute $B = b/a$ and $C = c/a$**: Let $B = \\frac{b}{a}$ and $C = \\frac{c}{a}.$ Then the equation becomes $z^2 + Bz + C = 0.$\n3. **Determine magnitudes of $B$ and $C$**: Since $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0,$ we have $|B| = |\\frac{b}{a}| = \\frac{|b|}{|a|} = 1$ and $|C| = |\\frac{c}{a}| = \\frac{|c|}{|a|} = 1.$\n4. **Apply the quadratic formula**: The solutions for $z$ are given by $z = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}}{2}.$\n5. **Maximize $|z|$**: We want to maximize $|z| = \\frac{|-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2} = \\frac{|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2}.$ To maximize $|z|,$ we need to maximize $|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|.$\n6. **Maximize $|\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|$**: We have $|\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = \\sqrt{|B^2 - 4C|}.$ By triangle inequality, $|B^2 - 4C| \\le |B^2| + |4C| = |B|^2 + 4|C| = 1^2 + 4(1) = 5.$ The maximum value of $|B^2 - 4C|$ is $5.$ This is achieved when $B^2$ and $-4C$ have the same argument.\n7. **Choose $B$ and $C$ to achieve maximum $|B^2 - 4C|$**: Let $B = 1,$ then $B^2 = 1.$ To make $-4C$ have the same argument as $B^2 = 1,$ we choose $-4C = 4,$ so $C = -1.$ Then $|B| = 1$ and $|C| = 1,$ which satisfy the conditions.\n8. **Calculate $z$ with chosen $B$ and $C$**: With $B = 1$ and $C = -1,$ $z = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(-1)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n9. **Find the largest $|z|$**: We have two solutions $z_1 = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $z_2 = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n$|z_1| = |\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}| = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}.$\n$|z_2| = |\\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}| = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\nThe largest value is $|z_2| = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}$",

We can use this inequality to manipulate the given equation.\n\n## Step 3: Manipulate the equation using the Triangle Inequality\nGiven $az^2 + bz + c = 0$, we can rearrange the terms to get $az^2 = -bz - c$. Taking the absolute value of both sides, we have $|az^2| = |-bz - c|$. By the Triangle Inequality, $|-bz - c| \\leq |bz| + |c|$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the given conditions to simplify\nSince $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$, let's denote this common absolute value as $k$. So, $|a| = |b| = |c| = k$. Therefore, $|az^2| = k|z|^2$, $|bz| = k|z|$, and $|c| = k$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the simplified conditions to the inequality\nSubstituting these into the inequality from Step 3, we get $k|z|^2 \\leq k|z| + k$.

Here, $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = -1$. Substituting these values in gives $|z| = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the range of $|z|$\nSince $|z|$ must be positive (because $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0$ and $z$ is a solution to the quadratic equation), the solution to the inequality is $\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\leq |z| \\leq \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.
