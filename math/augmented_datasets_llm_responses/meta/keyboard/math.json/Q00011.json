  "solution": "**Problem Statement**\n\nDetermine the values of the constant $c$ for which the rational function $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x+c}{x^2+x-6}$ has exactly one vertical asymptote.\nKey variables: $c$, function $f(x)$.\nConstraint: exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n**Solution Strategy**\n\nA vertical asymptote of a rational function occurs at the values of $x$ where the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero.\nFirst, find the roots of the denominator $x^2+x-6=0$.\nThen, for the function to have exactly one vertical asymptote, the numerator $x^2-x+c$ must be zero at exactly one of these roots and non-zero at the other root.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Find the roots of the denominator:**\n   Set the denominator $x^2+x-6 = 0$.\n   Factor the quadratic equation: $(x+3)(x-2) = 0$.\n   The roots of the denominator are $x = -3$ and $x = 2$.\n   These are the potential locations of vertical asymptotes.\n\n2. **Analyze the numerator for each root of the denominator:**\n   For exactly one vertical asymptote, the numerator $x^2-x+c$ must be zero for one of $x = -3$ or $x = 2$, and non-zero for the other.\n\n   Case 1: Numerator is zero at $x = -3$ and non-zero at $x = 2$.\n   If the numerator is zero at $x = -3$, then substitute $x = -3$ into the numerator and set it to zero:\n   $(-3)^2 - (-3) + c = 0$\n   $9 + 3 + c = 0$\n   $12 + c = 0$\n   $c = -12$\n   Now check if the numerator is non-zero at $x = 2$ when $c = -12$:\n   $(2)^2 - (2) + (-12) = 4 - 2 - 12 = 2 - 12 = -10 \\neq 0$\n   So, when $c = -12$, the numerator is zero at $x = -3$ and non-zero at $x = 2$. In this case, there is a hole at $x=-3$ and a vertical asymptote at $x=2$, thus exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n   Case 2: Numerator is zero at $x = 2$ and non-zero at $x = -3$.\n   If the numerator is zero at $x = 2$, then substitute $x = 2$ into the numerator and set it to zero:\n   $(2)^2 - (2) + c = 0$\n   $4 - 2 + c = 0$\n   $2 + c = 0$\n   $c = -2$\n   Now check if the numerator is non-zero at $x = -3$ when $c = -2$:\n   $(-3)^2 - (-3) + (-2) = 9 + 3 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 \\neq 0$\n   So, when $c = -2$, the numerator is zero at $x = 2$ and non-zero at $x = -3$. In this case, there is a hole at $x=2$ and a vertical asymptote at $x=-3$, thus exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n   Case 3: Numerator is zero at both $x = -3$ and $x = 2$.\n   As shown in the thought process, it's impossible for the numerator to be zero at both $x=-3$ and $x=2$ for a single value of $c$.\n\n3. **List the possible values of $c$:**\n   From Case 1, $c = -12$.\n   From Case 2, $c = -2$.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   For $c = -12$, $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x-12}{x^2+x-6} = \\frac{(x-4)(x+3)}{(x+3)(x-2)} = \\frac{x-4}{x-2}$ for $x \\neq -3$. Vertical asymptote at $x=2$.\n   For $c = -2$, $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x-2}{x^2+x-6} = \\frac{(x-2)(x+1)}{(x-2)(x+3)} = \\frac{x+1}{x+3}$ for $x \\neq 2$. Vertical asymptote at $x=-3$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{-12, -2}$",

To find the values of $c$ for which the graph of $f(x)$ has exactly one vertical asymptote, we first factor the denominator. The denominator $x^2 + x - 6$ can be factored into $(x + 3)(x - 2)$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify potential vertical asymptotes\nFrom the factored form of the denominator, $(x + 3)(x - 2)$, we can see that the potential vertical asymptotes are at $x = -3$ and $x = 2$, because these are the values of $x$ that make the denominator zero.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the conditions for having exactly one vertical asymptote\nFor the graph of $f(x)$ to have exactly one vertical asymptote, one of the potential vertical asymptotes must be canceled out by a factor in the numerator. This means the numerator $x^2 - x + c$ must have a factor of either $(x + 3)$ or $(x - 2)$.\n\n## Step 4: Check if the numerator can have a factor of $(x + 3)$\nFor the numerator to have a factor of $(x + 3)$, we must have $x^2 - x + c = 0$ when $x = -3$. Substituting $x = -3$ into the numerator gives $(-3)^2 - (-3) + c = 0$, which simplifies to $9 + 3 + c = 0$, or $12 + c = 0$. Solving for $c$ gives $c = -12$.\n\n## Step 5: Check if the numerator can have a factor of $(x - 2)$\nFor the numerator to have a factor of $(x - 2)$, we must have $x^2 - x + c = 0$ when $x = 2$. Substituting $x = 2$ into the numerator gives $2^2 - 2 + c = 0$, which simplifies to $4 - 2 + c = 0$, or $2 + c = 0$. Solving for $c$ gives $c = -2$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the values of $c$ for exactly one vertical asymptote\nThe values of $c$ that result in exactly one vertical asymptote are $c = -12$ and $c = -2$, because these values cause one of the factors in the denominator to be canceled out by a corresponding factor in the numerator.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-2}$"

The problem asks to find the value of $c$ for which the function has a vertical asymptote.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the denominator\nTo find the vertical asymptotes, we need to factor the denominator. The denominator $x^2 + x - 6$ can be factored as $(x + 3)(x - 2)$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the vertical asymptotes\nThe function will have vertical asymptotes at the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero, unless there is a factor in the numerator that cancels out the corresponding factor in the denominator. The values that make the denominator zero are $x = -3$ and $x = 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the condition for no vertical asymptote at x = 2\nFor there to be no vertical asymptote at $x = 2$, the numerator must have a factor of $(x - 2)$. This means $x^2 - x + c$ must equal zero when $x = 2$. So, we substitute $x = 2$ into the numerator: $2^2 - 2 + c = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for c\nSolving the equation $4 - 2 + c = 0$ gives $2 + c = 0$. Therefore, $c = -2$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-2}$"

          "## Step 1: Identify the equation and the condition for a single solution\nThe given equation is $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - x + c}{x^2 + x - 6}$. For the equation to have a single solution, the numerator must be a factor of the denominator, or the equation must be an identity after simplification.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the denominator\nThe denominator $x^2 + x - 6$ can be factored into $(x + 3)(x - 2)$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the condition for a single solution\nFor $f(x)$ to have a single solution, the numerator $x^2 - x + c$ must be of the form $k(x + 3)(x - 2)$, where $k$ is a constant, or it simplifies to a form that leads to a single solution when equated to the denominator.\n\n## Step 4: Expand the factored form of the numerator\nExpanding $k(x + 3)(x - 2)$ gives $k(x^2 + x - 6)$, which simplifies to $kx^2 + kx - 6k$.\n\n## Step 5: Equate coefficients\nComparing coefficients of $x^2 - x + c$ and $kx^2 + kx - 6k$, we get $k = 1$ (from $x^2$ term) and $-1 = k$ (from $x$ term), which is a contradiction, indicating the initial assumption about the form of the numerator might not be correct for a simple factor relationship.\n\n## Step 6: Reconsider the approach for a single solution\nGiven the contradiction, reconsider the condition for a single solution. The function $f(x)$ will have a single solution if the equation $\\frac{x^2 - x + c}{x^2 + x - 6} = 0$ has exactly one solution. This implies $x^2 - x + c = 0$ must have exactly one solution since the denominator cannot be zero for a defined value of $f(x)$.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the condition for one solution in a quadratic equation\nA quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ has exactly one solution when its discriminant $b^2 - 4ac = 0$. Applying this to $x^2 - x + c = 0$, we get $(-1)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for c\nSolving $1 - 4c = 0$ gives $-4c = -1$, thus $c = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$"

          "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nTo solve this problem, we first need to understand what is being asked. The problem involves finding the value of $c$ for which the function $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - x + c}{x^2 + x - 6}$ has a specific behavior.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the denominator\nThe denominator of the function can be factored into $(x + 3)(x - 2)$, which equals $x^2 + x - 6$. This step is crucial for understanding the behavior of the function, especially where it might have vertical asymptotes or holes.\n\n## Step 3: Identify critical points\nThe function $f(x)$ will have vertical asymptotes at $x = -3$ and $x = 2$, unless there is a factor in the numerator that cancels out either of these, which would create a hole instead of an asymptote.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the condition for a hole\nFor there to be a hole at $x = 2$ (since the problem hints at a specific behavior related to $x = 2$), the numerator must have a factor of $(x - 2)$. This implies that $x^2 - x + c$ should equal zero when $x = 2$ to create a hole.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for c\nSubstitute $x = 2$ into the equation $x^2 - x + c = 0$ to find $c$. This gives $2^2 - 2 + c = 0$, which simplifies to $4 - 2 + c = 0$, and further to $2 + c = 0$. Solving for $c$ yields $c = -2$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-2}$"

          "## Step 1: Identify the function and the problem\nThe given function is $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - x + c}{x^2 + x - 6}$. The problem asks to find the value of $c$ for which the function has a specific behavior, but the specific behavior is not clearly stated in the problem due to formatting issues. However, we can infer that we need to analyze the function for certain conditions such as vertical asymptotes, holes, or other behaviors that depend on $c$.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the denominator\nTo understand potential issues with the function, such as vertical asymptotes or holes, we should factor the denominator. The denominator $x^2 + x - 6$ can be factored into $(x + 3)(x - 2)$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify potential vertical asymptotes or holes\nVertical asymptotes occur where the denominator equals zero, unless there is a factor in the numerator that cancels out the corresponding factor in the denominator, which would create a hole instead. The denominator equals zero when $x = -3$ or $x = 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider conditions for holes\nFor there to be a hole at either $x = -3$ or $x = 2$, the numerator must have a factor of $(x + 3)$ or $(x - 2)$ respectively, which would cancel out the corresponding factor in the denominator. This implies that for a hole at $x = -3$, $(-3)^2 - (-3) + c = 0$, simplifying to $9 + 3 + c = 0$ or $c = -12$. For a hole at $x = 2$, $2^2 - 2 + c = 0$, simplifying to $4 - 2 + c = 0$ or $c = -2$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the relevance of the conditions\nGiven the problem statement's formatting issues, it seems we are looking for a condition related to the function's behavior that depends on $c$. Since we've identified potential values of $c$ that would create holes (and thus avoid vertical asymptotes) at specific points, we need to decide which, if any, of these conditions is relevant to the problem as stated.\n\n## Step 6: Choose the appropriate value of $c$\nWithout a clear condition from the problem statement, we must infer based on typical questions of this nature. Often, such problems ask for conditions under which the function has a specific behavior, like having a hole. Given that, we look for values of $c$ that create holes. However, without a specific condition (like a particular $x$ value or behavior), we must acknowledge that both $c = -12$ and $c = -2$ could be relevant depending on the intended behavior.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-2}$"
