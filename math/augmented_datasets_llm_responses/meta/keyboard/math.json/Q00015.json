  "solution": "## Problem Statement\nLet $\\omega$ be a complex number such that $\\omega^7 = 1$ and $\\omega \\ne 1.$  Compute\n\\[\\omega^{16} + \\omega^{18} + \\omega^{20} + \\dots + \\omega^{54}.\\]\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- $\\omega$ is a complex number\n- $\\omega^7 = 1$\n- $\\omega \\ne 1$\n- We need to compute the sum of the series $\\omega^{16} + \\omega^{18} + \\omega^{20} + \\dots + \\omega^{54}$\n\n## Solution Strategy\nThe given series is a geometric series.\nFirst, we need to identify the first term, common ratio, and the number of terms in the series.\nThen we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\nWe will also use the property $\\omega^7 = 1$ to simplify the terms.\nThe formula for the sum of a geometric series is $S_n = \\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$, where $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms.\nWe also know that for $\\omega \\ne 1$ and $\\omega^7 = 1$, we have $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^4 + \\omega^5 + \\omega^6 = 0.$\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Identify the type of series:** The given series is $\\omega^{16} + \\omega^{18} + \\omega^{20} + \\dots + \\omega^{54}$.\n   The ratio of consecutive terms is constant: $\\frac{\\omega^{18}}{\\omega^{16}} = \\omega^{18-16} = \\omega^2$, $\\frac{\\omega^{20}}{\\omega^{18}} = \\omega^{20-18} = \\omega^2$, and so on.\n   Thus, this is a geometric series with common ratio $r = \\omega^2$.\n\n2. **Identify the first term:** The first term is $a = \\omega^{16}$.\n\n3. **Determine the number of terms:** The exponents form an arithmetic sequence $16, 18, 20, \\dots, 54$ with first term $16$ and common difference $2$.\n   Let $n$ be the number of terms. The $n$-th term is given by $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\n   Here, $a_n = 54$, $a_1 = 16$, $d = 2$.\n   $54 = 16 + (n-1)2$\n   $54 - 16 = (n-1)2$\n   $38 = (n-1)2$\n   $19 = n-1$\n   $n = 20$.\n   There are $20$ terms in the series.\n\n4. **Apply the formula for the sum of a geometric series:**\n   $S_{20} = \\frac{a(1-r^{20})}{1-r} = \\frac{\\omega^{16}(1-(\\omega^2)^{20})}{1-\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\omega^{16}(1-\\omega^{40})}{1-\\omega^2}$.\n\n5. **Simplify the exponents using $\\omega^7 = 1$:**\n   $\\omega^{16} = \\omega^{2 \\cdot 7 + 2} = (\\omega^7)^2 \\cdot \\omega^2 = 1^2 \\cdot \\omega^2 = \\omega^2$.\n   $\\omega^{40} = \\omega^{5 \\cdot 7 + 5} = (\\omega^7)^5 \\cdot \\omega^5 = 1^5 \\cdot \\omega^5 = \\omega^5$.\n\n6. **Substitute the simplified terms back into the sum formula:**\n   $S_{20} = \\frac{\\omega^2(1-\\omega^5)}{1-\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\omega^2 - \\omega^2 \\cdot \\omega^5}{1-\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\omega^2 - \\omega^7}{1-\\omega^2}$.\n\n7. **Use $\\omega^7 = 1$ to further simplify:**\n   $S_{20} = \\frac{\\omega^2 - 1}{1-\\omega^2} = \\frac{- (1 - \\omega^2)}{1-\\omega^2}$.\n\n8. **Cancel out the common factor $(1-\\omega^2)$, provided $1-\\omega^2 \\ne 0$:**\n   Since $\\omega^7 = 1$ and $\\omega \\ne 1$, $\\omega$ is a 7th root of unity other than 1.\n   If $1 - \\omega^2 = 0$, then $\\omega^2 = 1$, which means $\\omega = \\pm 1$.\n   Since $\\omega \\ne 1$, we need to check if $\\omega = -1$ is possible. If $\\omega = -1$, then $\\omega^7 = (-1)^7 = -1 \\ne 1$, which contradicts $\\omega^7 = 1$.\n   Therefore, $\\omega \\ne -1$, and $\\omega^2 \\ne 1$, so $1 - \\omega^2 \\ne 0$.\n   We can cancel out $(1-\\omega^2)$:\n   $S_{20} = \\frac{- (1 - \\omega^2)}{1-\\omega^2} = -1$.\n\n## Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{-1}$",

          "## Step 1: Recognize that omega is a root of unity\nSince $\\omega^7 = 1$ and $\\omega \\neq 1$, $\\omega$ is a 7th root of unity excluding 1.\n\n## Step 2: Use the formula for the sum of a geometric series\nThe given expression can be seen as a geometric series with the first term $\\omega^{16}$ and the common ratio $\\omega^2$. The sum of a geometric series is given by $S = \\frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}$, where $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of terms in the series\nThe series starts with $\\omega^{16}$ and ends with $\\omega^{54}$. Since the common ratio is $\\omega^2$, the number of terms can be found by calculating $\\frac{54 - 16}{2} + 1 = 20$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the formula for the sum of a geometric series\nSubstituting $a = \\omega^{16}$, $r = \\omega^2$, and $n = 20$ into the formula gives $S = \\frac{\\omega^{16}(1 - (\\omega^2)^{20})}{1 - \\omega^2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression using the properties of roots of unity\nSince $\\omega^7 = 1$, we can simplify $\\omega^{16}$ as $\\omega^{16} = \\omega^{14} \\cdot \\omega^2 = (\\omega^7)^2 \\cdot \\omega^2 = 1^2 \\cdot \\omega^2 = \\omega^2$. Also, $(\\omega^2)^{20} = (\\omega^7)^{10} \\cdot \\omega^{10} \\cdot \\omega^2 \\cdot \\omega^2 = 1^{10} \\cdot \\omega^{10} \\cdot \\omega^4 = \\omega^{14} = (\\omega^7)^2 = 1^2 = 1$. Substituting these simplifications into the formula gives $S = \\frac{\\omega^2(1 - 1)}{1 - \\omega^2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Further simplify the expression\nSince $1 - 1 = 0$, the numerator becomes 0, and the expression simplifies to $S = \\frac{0}{1 - \\omega^2} = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-1}$"
