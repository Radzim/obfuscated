  "solution": "## Solution:\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nWe are asked to find the remainder when the polynomial $P(x) = 2x^4+11x^3-42x^2-60x+47$ is divided by the polynomial $D(x) = x^2+7x-5$.\nLet $P(x)$ be the dividend and $D(x)$ be the divisor. We need to find the remainder $R(x)$ in the division $P(x) \\div D(x)$.\nThe degree of $P(x)$ is 4 and the degree of $D(x)$ is 2.\nThe degree of the remainder $R(x)$ must be less than the degree of the divisor $D(x)$. Thus, the degree of $R(x)$ is at most 1. We can express the remainder in the form $R(x) = ax+b$.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use polynomial long division to find the quotient and the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $D(x)$.\nThe process involves repeatedly dividing the leading term of the current dividend by the leading term of the divisor, multiplying the result by the divisor, and subtracting it from the current dividend. We continue this process until the degree of the remaining polynomial is less than the degree of the divisor.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nWe perform polynomial long division:\n```\n        2x^2  -3x   -11\n      ___________________\nx^2+7x-5 | 2x^4 +11x^3 -42x^2 -60x  +47\n        -(2x^4 +14x^3 -10x^2)\n        ___________________\n              -3x^3 -32x^2 -60x\n             -(-3x^3 -21x^2 +15x)\n             ___________________\n                    -11x^2 -75x  +47\n                   -(-11x^2 -77x  +55)\n                   ___________________\n                           2x   -8\n```\n\n**Step 1:** Divide $2x^4$ by $x^2$ to get $2x^2$. Multiply $2x^2$ by $x^2+7x-5$ to get $2x^4+14x^3-10x^2$. Subtract this from the dividend:\n$(2x^4+11x^3-42x^2-60x+47) - (2x^4+14x^3-10x^2) = -3x^3-32x^2-60x+47$.\n\n**Step 2:** Divide $-3x^3$ by $x^2$ to get $-3x$. Multiply $-3x$ by $x^2+7x-5$ to get $-3x^3-21x^2+15x$. Subtract this from the result of Step 1:\n$(-3x^3-32x^2-60x+47) - (-3x^3-21x^2+15x) = -11x^2-75x+47$.\n\n**Step 3:** Divide $-11x^2$ by $x^2$ to get $-11$. Multiply $-11$ by $x^2+7x-5$ to get $-11x^2-77x+55$. Subtract this from the result of Step 2:\n$(-11x^2-75x+47) - (-11x^2-77x+55) = 2x-8$.\n\nThe degree of $2x-8$ is 1, which is less than the degree of $x^2+7x-5$. Thus, the remainder is $R(x) = 2x-8$.\nThe quotient is $Q(x) = 2x^2-3x-11$.\n\nWe can verify this by checking if $P(x) = Q(x)D(x) + R(x)$:\n$(2x^2-3x-11)(x^2+7x-5) + (2x-8)$\n$= 2x^2(x^2+7x-5) -3x(x^2+7x-5) -11(x^2+7x-5) + (2x-8)$\n$= (2x^4+14x^3-10x^2) + (-3x^3-21x^2+15x) + (-11x^2-77x+55) + (2x-8)$\n$= 2x^4 + (14x^3-3x^3) + (-10x^2-21x^2-11x^2) + (15x-77x+2x) + (55-8)$\n$= 2x^4 + 11x^3 - 42x^2 - 60x + 47$\nThis matches the original polynomial $P(x)$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe remainder when $x^2+7x-5$ divides $2x^4+11x^3-42x^2-60x+47$ is $2x-8$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2x-8}$",

However, interpreting the intent as checking divisibility between two polynomials, we'll assume the missing parts are placeholders for variables or constants that would make the expressions valid polynomials.\n\n## Step 2: Correct interpretation of the problem\nGiven the incomplete nature of the expressions, let's reinterpret the problem with a common and complete polynomial division scenario: checking if a polynomial $x^2 + 7x - a$ divides another polynomial, for example, $11x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$. The actual division and remainder would depend on the specific coefficients of the second polynomial.\n\n## Step 3: General approach to polynomial division\nIn polynomial division, we divide the highest degree term of the dividend by the highest degree term of the divisor to get the first term of the quotient. We then multiply the entire divisor by this term and subtract it from the dividend. This process is repeated until we cannot proceed further.\n\n## Step 4: Recognize the limitations\nWithout specific coefficients for the second polynomial (especially the missing parts indicated by \"^\" and the constants), we cannot perform the actual division to determine if there's a remainder.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion based on given information\nGiven the incomplete information, we cannot accurately determine if $x^2 + 7x -$ divides $+ 11x^3 - ^ - + 47$.

Subtracting this from $2x^4 + 11x^3 - 42x^2 + 47$ gives us $-3x^3 - 32x^2 + 47$.\n\n## Step 3: Repeat the process with the new polynomial $-3x^3 - 32x^2 + 47$.\nNow, divide the highest degree term of the new polynomial, $-3x^3$, by the highest degree term of the divisor, $x^2$, which gives $-3x$.\n\n## Step 4: Multiply the entire divisor by $-3x$ and subtract it from the new polynomial.\nMultiplying $x^2 + 7x - 5$ by $-3x$ gives $-3x^3 - 21x^2 + 15x$.
