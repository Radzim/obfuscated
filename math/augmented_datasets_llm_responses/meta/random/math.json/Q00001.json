  "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nCompute the square root of the expression formed by the product of four consecutive integers starting from 28, plus one.\nIn mathematical terms, evaluate $\\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1}$.\n\nKey variables:\n- We are asked to compute the square root of an expression.\n- The expression is formed by the product of four consecutive integers: 28, 29, 30, and 31, plus 1.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will try to find a pattern by considering similar expressions with smaller consecutive integers. We hypothesize that the expression inside the square root is a perfect square. We will then generalize the pattern algebraically to derive a formula for the square root of the product of four consecutive integers plus one. Finally, we will apply this formula to the given problem.\n\nRelevant formulas/theorems:\n- Algebraic manipulation\n- Recognizing perfect square trinomials, i.e., $(a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nLet's denote the expression inside the square root as $E = (31)(30)(29)(28)+1$.\nWe can rearrange the terms to identify a pattern:\n$E = (31 \\times 28) \\times (30 \\times 29) + 1$\n$E = (30+1)(30-2) \\times (30)(30-1) + 1$\n$E = (30^2 - 2 \\times 30 + 30 - 2) \\times (30^2 - 30) + 1$\n$E = (30^2 - 30 - 2) \\times (30^2 - 30) + 1$\n\nLet $x = 30^2 - 30$. Then $E = (x-2)x + 1 = x^2 - 2x + 1$.\nWe recognize that $x^2 - 2x + 1$ is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as $(x-1)^2$.\nSo, $E = (x-1)^2 = (30^2 - 30 - 1)^2$.\nNow we substitute back $x = 30^2 - 30 = 900 - 30 = 870$.\n$E = (870 - 1)^2 = (869)^2$.\n\nTherefore, $\\sqrt{E} = \\sqrt{(869)^2} = |869|$.\nSince 869 is positive, $\\sqrt{E} = 869$.\n\nAlternatively, let's generalize for four consecutive integers $n, n+1, n+2, n+3$.\nConsider the product $P = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$.\nRearrange the terms: $P = [n(n+3)][(n+1)(n+2)] = (n^2+3n)(n^2+3n+2)$.\nLet $y = n^2+3n$. Then $P = y(y+2) = y^2+2y$.\nSo $P+1 = y^2+2y+1 = (y+1)^2 = (n^2+3n+1)^2$.\nThus, $\\sqrt{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)+1} = \\sqrt{(n^2+3n+1)^2} = |n^2+3n+1|$.\nIn our problem, the four consecutive integers are $28, 29, 30, 31$. Let $n=28$.\nThen $n^2+3n+1 = 28^2 + 3(28) + 1 = 784 + 84 + 1 = 869$.\n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n$28^2 = 784$\n$3 \\times 28 = 84$\n$784 + 84 + 1 = 869$\n\nWe can also use the middle numbers approach.\nLet the integers be $n-1, n, n+1, n+2$. Let $n=29$.\nThen the integers are $28, 29, 30, 31$.\n$(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)+1 = [n(n+1)][(n-1)(n+2)]+1 = (n^2+n)(n^2+n-2)+1$.\nLet $z = n^2+n$. Then $(z)(z-2)+1 = z^2-2z+1 = (z-1)^2 = (n^2+n-1)^2$.\nFor $n=29$, $n^2+n-1 = 29^2+29-1 = 841+29-1 = 841+28 = 869$.\n\nFinal verification:\n$869^2 = 755161$.\n$(31)(30)(29)(28)+1 = 31 \\times 30 \\times 29 \\times 28 + 1 = 930 \\times 29 \\times 28 + 1 = 26970 \\times 28 + 1 = 755160 + 1 = 755161$.\nThus, $\\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1} = \\sqrt{755161} = 869$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{869}$",
