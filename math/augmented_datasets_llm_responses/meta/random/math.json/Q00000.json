Problem Statement**\nFind the smallest possible value of $|z + i|$ for a complex number $z$ satisfying $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|.$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\nWe simplify the equation $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|$ by substituting $z = x + yi$ and converting it into a real equation in $x$ and $y$. We then express $|z + i|$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ and minimize it under the derived constraint.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\nLet $z = x + yi$. The given condition is $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|$.\nSquaring both sides, we get $|z^2 + 4|^2 = |z|^2 |z + 2i|^2$.\nSubstituting $z = x + yi$, we have:\n$(x^2 - y^2 + 4)^2 + (2xy)^2 = (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + (y+2)^2)$.\nExpanding and simplifying this equation, we arrive at:\n$x^2(1 - y) = (y - 1)(y + 2)^2$.\nIf $y \\neq 1$, we have $x^2 = -(y + 2)^2$. Since $x^2 \\ge 0$ and $-(y+2)^2 \\le 0$, we must have $x^2 = 0$ and $-(y+2)^2 = 0$. This gives $x = 0$ and $y = -2$. Thus $z = -2i$.\nIf $y = 1$, the equation $x^2(1 - y) = (y - 1)(y + 2)^2$ becomes $0 = 0$, which holds for any $x$. In this case, $z = x + i$.\nWe want to minimize $|z + i|$.\nFor $z = -2i$, $|z + i| = |-2i + i| = |-i| = 1$.\nFor $z = x + i$, $|z + i| = |x + i + i| = |x + 2i| = \\sqrt{x^2 + 4}$. The minimum value is when $x = 0$, and the minimum value is $\\sqrt{0^2 + 4} = 2$.\nComparing the two minimum values $1$ and $2$, the smallest possible value of $|z + i|$ is $1$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

We need to find $|z|$.\n\n## Step 2: Expand the equation\nExpanding the right side of the equation, we get $|z^2 + 4| = |z^2 + 2iz|$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the definition of modulus\nThe modulus of a complex number $a + bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. Applying this to both sides of the equation, we have $\\sqrt{(z^2 + 4)(\\overline{z^2 + 4})} = \\sqrt{(z^2 + 2iz)(\\overline{z^2 + 2iz})}$, where $\\overline{z}$ denotes the conjugate of $z$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nLet $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Substituting this into the equation and simplifying, we get $|z^2 + 4| = |(a + bi)^2 + 4| = |(a^2 - b^2 + 4) + 2abi| = \\sqrt{(a^2 - b^2 + 4)^2 + (2ab)^2}$ and $|z^2 + 2iz| = |(a + bi)^2 + 2i(a + bi)| = |(a^2 - b^2 - 2b) + (2a + 2ab)i| = \\sqrt{(a^2 - b^2 - 2b)^2 + (2a + 2ab)^2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Equate the two expressions\nEquating the two expressions, we get $\\sqrt{(a^2 - b^2 + 4)^2 + (2ab)^2} = \\sqrt{(a^2 - b^2 - 2b)^2 + (2a + 2ab)^2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Square both sides\nSquaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots, we get $(a^2 - b^2 + 4)^2 + (2ab)^2 = (a^2 - b^2 - 2b)^2 + (2a + 2ab)^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Expand and simplify\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get $a^4 - 2a^2b^2 + b^4 + 8a^2 - 8b^2 + 16 + 4a^2b^2 = a^4 - 2a^2b^2 + b^4 - 4a^2b^2 + 4b^2 + 4a^2 + 8a^2b^2 + 4a^2b^2$.\n\n## Step 8: Combine like terms\nCombining like terms, we get $a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4 + 8a^2 - 8b^2 + 16 = a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4 + 4a^2 + 4b^2$.\n\n## Step 9: Cancel out terms\nCanceling out the common terms, we get $8a^2 - 8b^2 + 16 = 4a^2 + 4b^2$.\n\n## Step 10: Rearrange the equation\nRearranging the equation, we get $4a^2 - 12b^2 + 16 = 0$.\n\n## Step 11: Divide by 4\nDividing the equation by 4, we get $a^2 - 3b^2 + 4 = 0$.\n\n## Step 12: Rearrange to find $a^2$\nRearranging the equation to find $a^2$, we get $a^2 = 3b^2 - 4$.\n\n## Step 13: Express $|z|$ in terms of $a$ and $b$\nSince $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$, we substitute $a^2 = 3b^2 - 4$ into the equation to get $|z| = \\sqrt{3b^2 - 4 + b^2}$.\n\n## Step 14: Simplify the expression for $|z|$\nSimplifying the expression, we get $|z| = \\sqrt{4b^2 - 4}$.\n\n## Step 15: Factor out 4\nFactoring out 4, we get $|z| = \\sqrt{4(b^2 - 1)}$.\n\n## Step 16: Simplify further\nSimplifying further, we get $|z| = 2\\sqrt{b^2 - 1}$.\n\n## Step 17: Consider the condition for $|z|$ to be real\nFor $|z|$ to be real, $b^2 - 1 \\geq 0$, which means $b^2 \\geq 1$.\n\n## Step 18: Find the minimum value of $|z|$\nThe minimum value of $|z|$ occurs when $b^2 = 1$, which gives $|z| = 2\\sqrt{1 - 1} = 2\\sqrt{0} = 0$ or when $b^2$ is at its minimum, $|z|$ is at its minimum non-zero value. However, we need to consider the original equation and its implications on $z$.\n\n## Step 19: Reconsider the original equation\nGiven $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|$, if $z = 0$, then $|0^2 + 4| = |0(0 + 2i)|$ simplifies to $|4| = |0|$, which is not true. Thus, $z$ cannot be 0.\n\n## Step 20: Solve for $|z|$ with the condition that $z$ is not 0\nGiven that $z$ cannot be 0 and must satisfy the original equation, let's reconsider our steps and directly evaluate the condition that arises from the equation $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|$. This implies that the magnitudes of $z^2 + 4$ and $z^2 + 2iz$ are equal.\n\n## Step 21: Direct evaluation\nDirectly evaluating $|z^2 + 4| = |z||z + 2i|$, and knowing that $|z + 2i| = \\sqrt{(a + 0)^2 + (b + 2)^2}$, we can simplify the equation to find $|z|$.\n\n## Step 22: Simplify using $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$\nSince $|z^2 + 4| = |z||z + 2i|$, and $|z^2 + 4| = \\sqrt{(a^2 - b^2 + 4)^2 + (2ab)^2}$, $|z||z + 2i| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\sqrt{a^2 + (b + 2)^2}$, we need to find a condition that relates these expressions.\n\n## Step 23: Relate $|z^2 + 4|$ and $|z||z + 2i|$\nGiven the complexity of directly solving for $|z|$ from the previous steps, let's reconsider the relationship between $|z^2 + 4|$ and $|z||z + 2i|$. This relationship implies that the distance of $z^2$ from $-4$ is equal to the product of the distances of $z$ from $0$ and $z$ from $-2i$.\n\n## Step 24: Geometric interpretation\nGeometrically, this means that $z$ lies on a curve where the product of its distances from two fixed points ($0$ and $-2i$) is equal to its distance from a third fixed point ($-4$ on the real axis in the $z^2$ plane).\n\n## Step 25: Solve using geometric interpretation\nHowever, the geometric interpretation does not directly lead to a simple algebraic solution without considering specific properties of complex numbers and their geometric representations.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$"

Since we're dealing with absolute values, we should think about how the properties of absolute values and complex numbers apply.\n\n## Step 3: Apply properties of absolute values\nFor any complex number $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, the absolute value $|z|$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. However, without specific values for $z$, we need to approach this algebraically.\n\n## Step 4: Consider $z^2 +$ and $z(z +)$\nLet's denote $z$ as $z = a + bi$, but since we're looking for a general solution involving $|z + |$, we should directly manipulate the given equation.\n\n## Step 5: Manipulate the equation\nGiven $|z^2 + | = |z(z +)|$, we notice that $z^2 +$ can be seen as $z^2 + 1$ to make it a complete expression. Thus, we have $|z^2 + 1| = |z(z + 1)|$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply absolute value properties to the equation\n$|z^2 + 1| = |z||z + 1|$. This simplification comes from the property that $|ab| = |a||b|$ for complex numbers.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $|z + 1|$\nDividing both sides by $|z|$, assuming $z \\neq 0$, we get $|z + 1| = \\frac{|z^2 + 1|}{|z|}$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the expression\nTo simplify, consider $|z^2 + 1|$ as $\\sqrt{(z^2 + 1)(\\overline{z^2 + 1})}$ and $|z|$ as $\\sqrt{z\\overline{z}}$, but since we're looking for a general form, we keep it as $|z + 1| = \\frac{|z^2 + 1|}{|z|}$.\n\n## Step 9: Realize the simplification mistake\nThe step of simplifying $|z^2 + 1|$ directly into a form involving $z$ and $\\overline{z}$ may not be straightforward without specific values. The key insight is recognizing that $|z^2 + 1|$ does not simplify in an obvious way without knowing $z$.\n\n## Step 10: Correct approach\nGiven the equation and the goal to find $|z + 1|$, we should directly use the fact that $|z^2 + 1| = |z||z + 1|$ implies $|z + 1| = \\frac{|z^2 + 1|}{|z|}$. This step actually concludes the process since we've expressed $|z + 1|$ in terms of $|z|$ and $|z^2 + 1|$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$"

          "## Step 1: Understand the given equation\nThe equation provided is $|x| + |y| = |z| |z + 1|$. We need to find $|x| + |y|$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the properties of absolute value\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, without considering direction. Therefore, $|z| \\geq 0$ and $|z + 1| \\geq 0$ for all real numbers $z$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider cases for z\nTo find the minimum value of $|z| |z + 1|$, we should consider different cases for $z$. The critical points occur at $z = 0$ and $z = -1$ because these are the points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the case when $z < -1$\nWhen $z < -1$, both $z$ and $z + 1$ are negative. Thus, $|z| = -z$ and $|z + 1| = -(z + 1)$. The product $|z| |z + 1| = (-z)(-(z + 1)) = z(z + 1)$.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the case when $-1 \\leq z < 0$\nWhen $-1 \\leq z < 0$, $z$ is negative but $z + 1$ is non-negative. Thus, $|z| = -z$ and $|z + 1| = z + 1$. The product $|z| |z + 1| = (-z)(z + 1) = -z(z + 1)$.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the case when $z \\geq 0$\nWhen $z \\geq 0$, both $z$ and $z + 1$ are non-negative. Thus, $|z| = z$ and $|z + 1| = z + 1$. The product $|z| |z + 1| = z(z + 1)$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the minimum value of $|z| |z + 1|$\nFrom the cases examined, the minimum value of $|z| |z + 1|$ occurs when $z = -\\frac{1}{2}$ because this is where the quadratic function $z(z + 1)$ has its vertex, and since $z(z + 1) = z^2 + z$, completing the square gives $z^2 + z + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = (z + \\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\frac{1}{4}$. The minimum value of $(z + \\frac{1}{2})^2$ is 0 at $z = -\\frac{1}{2}$, making the minimum of $|z| |z + 1|$ equal to $-\\frac{1}{4}$ when considering the vertex, but since we are looking at the product of two absolute values, the actual minimum occurs at the boundary values or where the function's behavior changes, which are $z = 0$ or $z = -1$. At $z = -1$, $|z| |z + 1| = 0$, and at $z = 0$, $|z| |z + 1| = 0$. Thus, the minimum value of $|z| |z + 1|$ is 0.\n\n## Step 8: Conclude the minimum value of $|x| + |y|$\nGiven that the minimum value of $|z| |z + 1|$ is 0, we conclude that the minimum value of $|x| + |y|$ must also be 0 to satisfy the equation $|x| + |y| = |z| |z + 1|$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$"
