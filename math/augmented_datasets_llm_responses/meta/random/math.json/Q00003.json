So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n        $(x^2 - 10x + 25) - 50y^2 = 0$\n        The first three terms form a perfect square: $(x - 5)^2$.\n        So the equation becomes:\n        $(x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0$\n        This equation is in the form $X^2 - Y^2 = 0$, where $X = (x - 5)$ and $Y = \\sqrt{50}y$.\n        We can factor this equation as a difference of squares:\n        $[(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y][(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y] = 0$\n        This means either $(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y = 0$ or $(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y = 0$.\n        These are the equations of two lines:\n        Line 1: $(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y = 0 \\implies \\sqrt{50}y = (x - 5) \\implies y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}}(x - 5) = \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2}}(x - 5) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}(x - 5)$\n        Line 2: $(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y = 0 \\implies -\\sqrt{50}y = (x - 5) \\implies y = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}}(x - 5) = -\\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2}}(x - 5) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}(x - 5)$\n        These are two distinct lines passing through the point $(5, 0)$ with slopes $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}$ and $-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}$.\n        Therefore, the graph of the equation is two lines.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Final Answer}\n        \\boxed{\\text{two lines}}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n```",

          "## Step 1: Identify the given equation and its standard form\nThe given equation is $x^2 - 50y^2 - 10x + 25 = 0$. To identify the type of conic section represented by this equation, we need to rewrite it in its standard form by completing the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms.\n\n## Step 2: Complete the square for the $x$ terms\nWe start with the $x$ terms: $x^2 - 10x$. To complete the square, we add $(\\frac{-10}{2})^2 = 25$ to both sides of the equation. However, since we're just rearranging the equation, we'll focus on manipulating the $x$ terms first.\n\n## Step 3: Complete the square for the $x$ terms and consider the $y$ terms\nThe equation can be rewritten as $(x^2 - 10x + 25) - 50y^2 = -25 + 25$, which simplifies to $(x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0$ after adding 25 to both sides to complete the square for $x$ and simplifying the constants.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the resulting equation\nThe equation $(x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0$ can be factored as a difference of squares: $[(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y][(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y] = 0$. This gives us two linear equations: $(x - 5) - \\sqrt{50}y = 0$ and $(x - 5) + \\sqrt{50}y = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the type of conic section\nSince the equation factors into two linear equations, it represents two lines. The presence of the squared terms for both $x$ and $y$ initially suggested a conic section, but the fact that it simplifies to a product of two linear equations indicates that the graph consists of two intersecting lines.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{lines}$"

However, the right side is a constant, which means it's not a standard hyperbola equation. \n\nBut looking closely at the coefficients and the constant term, we can see that the constant term -1/8 is not zero. If we try to rewrite the equation as:\n\n50(y - 1/100)^2 - (x - 1/2)^2 + 1/8 = 0\n\nThis can be rearranged into:\n\n50(y - 1/100)^2 = (x - 1/2)^2 - 1/8\n\nSince (x - 1/2)^2 is always greater than or equal to zero, the right-hand side (x - 1/2)^2 - 1/8 will be greater than or equal to -1/8. \n\nHowever, there are no real values of y that can make 50(y - 1/100)^2 equal to a negative number. \n\nBut in this equation, the term (x - 1/2)^2 - 1/8 can be zero when x = 1/2 +/- sqrt(1/8) = 1/2 +/- 1/(2*sqrt(2)) and y = 1/100. \n\nWhen we plug these x values into the equation and solve for y, we will get two lines.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{lines}$"

This means there is only one solution for $x$, which is $x = 5$.\n\n## Step 5: Interpret the result in the context of the question\nGiven that the equation represents a parabola and we found a single solution, it indicates the parabola touches the x-axis at one point, which is $(5, 0)$. This is consistent with the equation having a repeated root, meaning the discriminant ($b^2 - 4ac$) is 0, which is the case here.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$"
