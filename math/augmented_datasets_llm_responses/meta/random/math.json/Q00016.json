  "solution": "**1. Problem Statement**\n\nDetermine all possible integer roots of a polynomial equation of the form $x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x - 11 = 0$, where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are integer coefficients.\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Polynomial form: $x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x - 11 = 0$\n- Coefficients $a_1, a_2$ are integers.\n- We are looking for integer roots of this polynomial.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use the Integer Root Theorem to find the possible integer roots of the given polynomial.\nThe Integer Root Theorem states that if a polynomial with integer coefficients $P(x) = c_n x^n + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + c_1 x + c_0$ has an integer root $r$, then $r$ must be a divisor of the constant term $c_0$.\n\nIn our polynomial $P(x) = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x - 11$, the coefficients are integers (1, $a_2$, $a_1$, -11), and the constant term is $c_0 = -11$.\nTherefore, any integer root of this polynomial must be a divisor of $-11$.\nWe will find all divisors of $-11$ and these will be the possible integer roots.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nStep 1: Identify the constant term of the polynomial.\nThe constant term of the polynomial $x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x - 11 = 0$ is $-11$.\n\nStep 2: Find all integer divisors of the constant term $-11$.\nWe need to find all integers that divide $-11$ without leaving a remainder.\nThe divisors of $11$ are $1, 11, -1, -11$.\nThe divisors of $-11$ are also $1, 11, -1, -11$.\nWe can list them as $\\pm 1, \\pm 11$.\nThe divisors are: $1, -1, 11, -11$.\n\nStep 3: Verify if each divisor is a possible integer root.\nFor each divisor $r$ from the set $\\{1, -1, 11, -11\\}$, we need to check if there exist integers $a_1$ and $a_2$ such that $r$ is a root of the polynomial.\nIf $r$ is a root, then $P(r) = r^3 + a_2 r^2 + a_1 r - 11 = 0$. We need to show that we can find integers $a_1, a_2$ satisfying this equation for each $r$.\n\nCase 1: $r = 1$\n$P(1) = 1^3 + a_2 (1)^2 + a_1 (1) - 11 = 1 + a_2 + a_1 - 11 = a_2 + a_1 - 10 = 0$\n$a_2 + a_1 = 10$.\nWe can choose integer values for $a_1$ and $a_2$ that satisfy this equation, e.g., $a_1 = 0, a_2 = 10$. So $x=1$ is a possible integer root.\n\nCase 2: $r = -1$\n$P(-1) = (-1)^3 + a_2 (-1)^2 + a_1 (-1) - 11 = -1 + a_2 - a_1 - 11 = a_2 - a_1 - 12 = 0$\n$a_2 - a_1 = 12$.\nWe can choose integer values for $a_1$ and $a_2$ that satisfy this equation, e.g., $a_1 = 0, a_2 = 12$. So $x=-1$ is a possible integer root.\n\nCase 3: $r = 11$\n$P(11) = (11)^3 + a_2 (11)^2 + a_1 (11) - 11 = 0$\nDivide by $11$: $11^2 + a_2 (11) + a_1 - 1 = 121 + 11a_2 + a_1 - 1 = 120 + 11a_2 + a_1 = 0$\n$11a_2 + a_1 = -120$.\nWe can choose integer values for $a_1$ and $a_2$ that satisfy this equation, e.g., $a_2 = -10, a_1 = -10$. So $x=11$ is a possible integer root.\n\nCase 4: $r = -11$\n$P(-11) = (-11)^3 + a_2 (-11)^2 + a_1 (-11) - 11 = 0$\nDivide by $-11$: $(-11)^2 - a_2 (11) - a_1 + 1 = 121 - 11a_2 - a_1 + 1 = 122 - 11a_2 - a_1 = 0$\n$11a_2 + a_1 = 122$.\nWe can choose integer values for $a_1$ and $a_2$ that satisfy this equation, e.g., $a_2 = 10, a_1 = 2$. So $x=-11$ is a possible integer root.\n\nAll divisors of $-11$ are possible integer roots.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe possible integer roots are the divisors of $-11$, which are $1, -1, 11, -11$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1, -1, 11, -11}$",

The constant term is \\(-1\\), which means that the product of the roots of the polynomial is \\(-1\\) (by Vieta's formulas). Since we are dealing with a cubic equation, let's consider the possible integer roots that could multiply to give \\(-1\\). The integer roots could be \\(-1, 1\\), or a combination of integers whose product is \\(-1\\).\n\nHowever, without specific constraints on \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_1\\), there are infinitely many combinations because \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_1\\) can be any integer that satisfies the equation for specific roots. But, we can consider simple cases where the roots are integers.\n\nFor example, if one root is \\(1\\), then the equation becomes:\n\\[(x - 1)(x^2 + bx + 1) = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x - 1\\]\nExpanding and matching coefficients, we get conditions on \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_1\\), but without further constraints, we cannot list all possible integer coefficients without considering specific roots.\n\nIf we consider the factorization of the polynomial with integer roots, for simplicity, let's assume one root is \\(-1\\), then:\n\\[(x + 1)(x^2 + cx - 1) = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x - 1\\]\nThis gives us another set of conditions on \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_1\\), but again, without specific roots or constraints, we cannot enumerate all possibilities.\n\nGiven the nature of the question, it seems to be asking for a general approach to finding \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_1\\), but without additional constraints (like specific roots or a range for \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_1\\)), the problem does not have a finite set of integer solutions.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-1,1}$"

This theorem states that any rational root of the polynomial must be of the form p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is -11, and the leading coefficient is 1. The factors of -11 are \u00b11 and \u00b111.\n\nSo, the possible rational roots of the polynomial are \u00b11 and \u00b111.\n\nWe can test these values by plugging them into the polynomial:\n\nFor x = 1: (1)^3 + a_2(1)^2 + a_1(1) - 11 = 1 + a_2 + a_1 - 11 = a_2 + a_1 - 10\nFor x = -1: (-1)^3 + a_2(-1)^2 + a_1(-1) - 11 = -1 + a_2 - a_1 - 11 = a_2 - a_1 - 12\nFor x = 11: (11)^3 + a_2(11)^2 + a_1(11) - 11 = 1331 + 121a_2 + 11a_1 - 11 = 121a_2 + 11a_1 + 1320\nFor x = -11: (-11)^3 + a_2(-11)^2 + a_1(-11) - 11 = -1331 + 121a_2 - 11a_1 - 11 = 121a_2 - 11a_1 - 1342\n\nSince the polynomial has integer coefficients, we know that the roots must be integers.

However, interpreting the task as needing to solve a polynomial equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are coefficients that we need to determine based on the given information, we can proceed with a general approach to solving quadratic equations.\n\nGiven the equation is not fully specified, let's assume a general quadratic equation:\n\\[ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\]\n\nThe solutions to this equation can be found using the quadratic formula:\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nWithout specific values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), we cannot calculate a numerical solution. However, if we were to assume example values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), we could demonstrate how to solve it. For instance, if \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -3\\), and \\(c = 2\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\\[x = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2}}{2 \\cdot 1}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 8}}{2}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{3 \\pm 1}{2}\\]\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\\[x_1 = \\frac{3 + 1}{2} = 2\\]\n\\[x_2 = \\frac{3 - 1}{2} = 1\\]\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$"
