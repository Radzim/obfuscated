  "solution": "### 1. **Problem Statement**\n\nThe function $f(x)$ satisfies the functional equation $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y.$  We are also given that $f(4) = 5.$  The objective is to find the value of $f(5).$\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- Function: $f(x)$\n- Functional equation: $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ for all real $x, y$\n- Given value: $f(4) = 5$\n- Objective: Find $f(5)$\n\n### 2. **Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use the property of the given functional equation $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y).$  This is Cauchy's functional equation.  A property derived from this equation is $f(nx) = n f(x)$ for any integer $n.$ We will use this property to relate $f(4)$ and $f(5)$ to $f(1),$ and then use the given value of $f(4)$ to find $f(1),$ and finally calculate $f(5).$\n\nAlternatively, we can assume a linear form for $f(x)$ based on Cauchy's functional equation (assuming continuity, though not strictly needed for this problem as we only need to find $f(5)$ based on $f(4)$). We assume $f(x) = cx$ and use the condition $f(4) = 5$ to find $c,$ and then calculate $f(5).$\n\nFormulas/theorems:\n- Property of Cauchy's functional equation: $f(nx) = n f(x)$ for integer $n.$\n- For rational $x,$ $f(x) = cx$ where $c = f(1).$\n\n### 3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1:** Use the property $f(nx) = n f(x)$ for integer $n.$\nLet $x = 1.$ Then $f(n) = f(n \\cdot 1) = n f(1)$ for any integer $n.$\nIn particular, for $n = 4,$ we have $f(4) = 4 f(1).$\n\n**Step 2:** Use the given value $f(4) = 5$ to find $f(1).$\nWe have $f(4) = 4 f(1) = 5.$\nDividing both sides by 4, we get $f(1) = \\frac{5}{4}.$\n\n**Step 3:** Use the property $f(n) = n f(1)$ for integer $n$ to find $f(5).$\nFor $n = 5,$ we have $f(5) = 5 f(1).$\nSubstitute the value of $f(1) = \\frac{5}{4}$ into the expression for $f(5).$\n$f(5) = 5 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{25}{4}.$\n\n**Alternatively, using the linear form:**\nAssume $f(x) = cx.$\nSubstitute this into the functional equation:\n$f(x+y) = c(x+y) = cx + cy = f(x) + f(y).$\nSo $f(x) = cx$ is a solution.\nUse the condition $f(4) = 5.$\n$f(4) = c \\times 4 = 5.$\n$c = \\frac{5}{4}.$\nThus $f(x) = \\frac{5}{4} x.$\nNow find $f(5).$\n$f(5) = \\frac{5}{4} \\times 5 = \\frac{25}{4}.$\n\n**Verification:**\nCheck if $f(x) = \\frac{25}{4} x$ satisfies $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ and $f(4) = 5.$\n$f(x + y) = \\frac{5}{4} (x + y) = \\frac{5}{4} x + \\frac{5}{4} y = f(x) + f(y).$  (Correct)\n$f(4) = \\frac{5}{4} \\times 4 = 5.$ (Correct)\nSo the conditions are satisfied.\n\n### 4. **Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{4}}$",

This is a classic example of Cauchy's functional equation.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given property to derive a relationship for f(0)\nLet's set $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ in the given equation to find $f(0)$. We get $f(0 + 0) = f(0) + f(0)$, which simplifies to $f(0) = 2f(0)$. This implies $f(0) = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Derive the relationship for f(x) using the given property and f(1) = 1\nNow, let's use the property $f(x + 1) = f(x) + f(1)$ to derive a relationship for $f(x)$. Since $f(1) = 1$, we have $f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1$. This means that for every increment of $1$ in $x$, $f(x)$ increases by $1$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the general form of f(x) for integer values\nUsing the relationship $f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1$ and starting from $f(0) = 0$, we can derive $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 2$, $f(3) = 3$, and so on. This suggests that $f(x) = x$ for integer values of $x$.\n\n## Step 5: Extend the result to all real numbers\nAlthough the given property and the derivation directly apply to integer values, the nature of the function $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ suggests linearity, which can be extended to all real numbers. Thus, we infer $f(x) = x$ for all real $x$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{x}$"

Starting with $f(1) = 1$, we can find $f(2)$ by setting $x = y = 1$, which gives $f(2) = f(1 + 1) = f(1) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2$. By induction, we can show that $f(n) = n$ for any positive integer $n$.\n\n## Step 3: Extend the function to rational values\nTo extend the function to rational numbers, consider $f\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$.
