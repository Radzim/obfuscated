  "solution": "**Problem Statement**\n\nDetermine the values of the constant $c$ for which the rational function $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x+c}{x^2+x-6}$ has exactly one vertical asymptote.\nKey variables: $c$, function $f(x)$.\nConstraint: exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n**Solution Strategy**\n\nA vertical asymptote of a rational function occurs at the values of $x$ where the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero.\nFirst, find the roots of the denominator $x^2+x-6=0$.\nThen, for the function to have exactly one vertical asymptote, the numerator $x^2-x+c$ must be zero at exactly one of these roots and non-zero at the other root.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Find the roots of the denominator:**\n   Set the denominator $x^2+x-6 = 0$.\n   Factor the quadratic equation: $(x+3)(x-2) = 0$.\n   The roots of the denominator are $x = -3$ and $x = 2$.\n   These are the potential locations of vertical asymptotes.\n\n2. **Analyze the numerator for each root of the denominator:**\n   For exactly one vertical asymptote, the numerator $x^2-x+c$ must be zero for one of $x = -3$ or $x = 2$, and non-zero for the other.\n\n   Case 1: Numerator is zero at $x = -3$ and non-zero at $x = 2$.\n   If the numerator is zero at $x = -3$, then substitute $x = -3$ into the numerator and set it to zero:\n   $(-3)^2 - (-3) + c = 0$\n   $9 + 3 + c = 0$\n   $12 + c = 0$\n   $c = -12$\n   Now check if the numerator is non-zero at $x = 2$ when $c = -12$:\n   $(2)^2 - (2) + (-12) = 4 - 2 - 12 = 2 - 12 = -10 \\neq 0$\n   So, when $c = -12$, the numerator is zero at $x = -3$ and non-zero at $x = 2$. In this case, there is a hole at $x=-3$ and a vertical asymptote at $x=2$, thus exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n   Case 2: Numerator is zero at $x = 2$ and non-zero at $x = -3$.\n   If the numerator is zero at $x = 2$, then substitute $x = 2$ into the numerator and set it to zero:\n   $(2)^2 - (2) + c = 0$\n   $4 - 2 + c = 0$\n   $2 + c = 0$\n   $c = -2$\n   Now check if the numerator is non-zero at $x = -3$ when $c = -2$:\n   $(-3)^2 - (-3) + (-2) = 9 + 3 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 \\neq 0$\n   So, when $c = -2$, the numerator is zero at $x = 2$ and non-zero at $x = -3$. In this case, there is a hole at $x=2$ and a vertical asymptote at $x=-3$, thus exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n   Case 3: Numerator is zero at both $x = -3$ and $x = 2$.\n   As shown in the thought process, it's impossible for the numerator to be zero at both $x=-3$ and $x=2$ for a single value of $c$.\n\n3. **List the possible values of $c$:**\n   From Case 1, $c = -12$.\n   From Case 2, $c = -2$.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   For $c = -12$, $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x-12}{x^2+x-6} = \\frac{(x-4)(x+3)}{(x+3)(x-2)} = \\frac{x-4}{x-2}$ for $x \\neq -3$. Vertical asymptote at $x=2$.\n   For $c = -2$, $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x-2}{x^2+x-6} = \\frac{(x-2)(x+1)}{(x-2)(x+3)} = \\frac{x+1}{x+3}$ for $x \\neq 2$. Vertical asymptote at $x=-3$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{-12, -2}$",

          "To find the values of $c$ for which the function $f(x) = \\frac{-x + c}{x^2 - 6}$ has one asymptote, we need to consider the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.\n\nVertical asymptotes occur when the denominator is equal to zero, i.e., $x^2 - 6 = 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\pm \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nHorizontal asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, which is the case here. The horizontal asymptote is $y = 0$.\n\nHowever, if the numerator has a factor that cancels out one of the factors in the denominator, then there will be a hole at that point instead of a vertical asymptote.\n\nFor the function $f(x)$ to have only one asymptote, we need to cancel out one of the factors in the denominator. The denominator can be factored as $x^2 - 6 = (x - \\sqrt{6})(x + \\sqrt{6})$.\n\nTo cancel out one of these factors, the numerator $-x + c$ must have a factor of $x - \\sqrt{6}$ or $x + \\sqrt{6}$. This means $-x + c$ must be equal to $-(x - \\sqrt{6})$ or $-(x + \\sqrt{6})$.\n\nEquating $-x + c$ to $-(x - \\sqrt{6})$, we get $-x + c = -x + \\sqrt{6}$, which gives $c = \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nEquating $-x + c$ to $-(x + \\sqrt{6})$, we get $-x + c = -x - \\sqrt{6}$, which gives $c = -\\sqrt{6}$.\n\nTherefore, the values of $c$ for which the function $f(x)$ has one asymptote are $\\sqrt{6}$ and $-\\sqrt{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{6},-\\sqrt{6}}$."

          "## Step 1: Factor the denominator to find potential vertical asymptotes\nThe function given is $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - x + c}{x^2 + x - 6}$. To find vertical asymptotes, we first factor the denominator. The denominator $x^2 + x - 6$ can be factored into $(x + 3)(x - 2)$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify potential vertical asymptotes\nFrom the factored form of the denominator, $(x + 3)(x - 2)$, we can see that the potential vertical asymptotes are at $x = -3$ and $x = 2$, because these are the values of $x$ that make the denominator zero.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the condition for having exactly one vertical asymptote\nFor the function to have exactly one vertical asymptote, either the factor $(x + 3)$ or $(x - 2)$ in the denominator must be canceled out by a corresponding factor in the numerator. This means the numerator must have a factor of either $(x + 3)$ or $(x - 2)$ for the function to have exactly one vertical asymptote.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the condition for the numerator to cancel out a factor in the denominator\nTo cancel out $(x - 2)$, the numerator $x^2 - x + c$ must have a factor of $(x - 2)$. This implies that $x^2 - x + c$ must equal zero when $x = 2$. Substituting $x = 2$ into the numerator gives $2^2 - 2 + c = 0$, which simplifies to $4 - 2 + c = 0$ or $2 + c = 0$. Solving for $c$ gives $c = -2$.\n\n## Step 5: Verify if canceling out (x + 3) is possible\nTo cancel out $(x + 3)$, we substitute $x = -3$ into the numerator: $(-3)^2 - (-3) + c = 0$. This simplifies to $9 + 3 + c = 0$ or $12 + c = 0$. Solving for $c$ gives $c = -12$.\n\n## Step 6: Conclusion on values of c for exactly one vertical asymptote\nFor the function to have exactly one vertical asymptote, $c$ must be either $-2$ (to cancel out the $x - 2$ factor) or $-12$ (to cancel out the $x + 3$ factor).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-2, -12}$"

This means the numerator $x^2 + c$ must have a factor of either $(x + 3)$ or $(x - 2)$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the value of $c$ for each case\n- For the numerator to have a factor of $(x + 3)$, we must have $x^2 + c = (x + 3)(x - k)$ for some constant $k$. However, to directly cancel a factor in the denominator, we should consider the roots of the numerator matching one of the roots of the denominator.\n- For the numerator to have a factor of $(x - 2)$, we set $x = 2$ and solve for $c$ because if $x = 2$ is a root of the numerator, it cancels the $(x - 2)$ factor in the denominator. So, $2^2 + c = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $c$ when $x = 2$ is a root of the numerator\n$2^2 + c = 0 \\Rightarrow 4 + c = 0 \\Rightarrow c = -4$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $c$ when $x = -3$ is a root of the numerator\nSimilarly, for $x = -3$ to be a root of the numerator, we set $(-3)^2 + c = 0$. So, $9 + c = 0 \\Rightarrow c = -9$.\n\n## Step 7: Conclusion\nThe values of $c$ that make the function have one vertical asymptote are $-4$ and $-9$, because these values cause the numerator to cancel out one of the factors in the denominator.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-4, -9}$"

Given the standard form of a rational function $y = \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, vertical asymptotes occur at $x$ values where $g(x) = 0$ and $f(x) \\neq 0$. The value of $c$ would typically affect the position of horizontal asymptotes or the behavior of the function in terms of $y$-intercepts or other characteristics, not directly the vertical asymptotes unless it's part of the denominator or affects the degree of the polynomial in the numerator or denominator.\n\n## Step 5: Re-evaluate the problem statement for clarity and correctness\nGiven the equation $y = \\frac{x^2 - 4 + c}{x^2 - 6}$, to find $c$ such that the graph has vertical asymptotes, we actually look at the conditions that make the denominator zero without making the numerator zero. The value of $c$ does not directly influence the location of vertical asymptotes but rather whether the function has a hole or an asymptote at a particular $x$ if it affects the numerator.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the condition for $c$ to have vertical asymptotes\nFor $x = \\pm\\sqrt{6}$ to be vertical asymptotes, the numerator should not equal zero at these $x$ values. Thus, we substitute $x = \\pm\\sqrt{6}$ into the numerator and solve for $c$ to ensure the numerator does not equal zero: $(\\pm\\sqrt{6})^2 - 4 + c \\neq 0$. Simplifying, $6 - 4 + c \\neq 0$, which gives $ + c \\neq 0$. Therefore, $c \\neq -2$ for the function to have vertical asymptotes at $x = \\pm\\sqrt{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-2}$"

The use of \"^\" suggests exponentiation, but without clear bases or exponents, we must infer the operations from the given symbols.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the equation structure\nThe equation structure implies that we are looking for a relationship between two sets of operations that yield the same result. The first part \"{^ - +}\" and the second part \"{^ + -}\" must be balanced in such a way that they equal each other or a specific value when the operations are applied.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the limitations\nWithout specific numbers or a clear indication of what the \"^\" symbol represents in this context (whether it's exponentiation or something else), and given the abstract nature of the problem, it seems we're missing crucial information to solve this in a conventional mathematical sense.\n\n## Step 6: Look for a logical or pattern-based approach\nGiven the abstract nature and the lack of specific mathematical operations or numbers, we might need to think about common mathematical patterns or identities that could fit this structure. However, without more context or a clearer definition of the operations represented by the symbols, we're left to make assumptions.\n\n## Step 7: Conclusion\nGiven the information provided and the format of the question, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a lack of clarity in the problem statement as presented. The problem does not provide enough context or specific mathematical operations to solve it in a standard mathematical way.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$"

          "## Step 1: Understand the given expression\nThe given expression is $() = \\ {^ - +} {^ + -}$. This seems to be a puzzle where we need to fill in the blanks with mathematical operations to make the equation true.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern\nLooking closely, the expression involves a pattern where the operations are applied in a specific order. The first blank seems to involve a subtraction, and the second blank seems to involve an addition.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the pattern to solve the equation\nIf we apply the pattern, we get $0 = 0^{-} + 0^{+}$, but this doesn't make sense in the context of the given problem as it doesn't follow standard mathematical operations for zero. Let's reconsider the approach.\n\n## Step 4: Reconsider the equation with standard mathematical operations\nGiven the nature of the problem, it seems we are looking for a simple mathematical operation that fits the pattern. A common operation that could fit is considering the equation as $1 = 1^{-1} + 1^{+1}$, but this doesn't directly apply since $1^{-1}$ is $1$ and $1^{+1}$ is $1$, which doesn't fit the equation $1 = 1 + 1$. The equation provided doesn't directly translate to standard mathematical operations without more context.\n\n## Step 5: Consider an alternative approach based on the pattern of operations\nGiven the structure $() = \\ {^ - +} {^ + -}$, if we think about basic arithmetic operations that could fit this pattern in a simple equation, we might consider $1 = 1 - 0 + 0 - 0$ or similar, but this doesn't fit the given format well. The problem seems to be about finding operations that fit a specific pattern rather than standard arithmetic.\n\n## Step 6: Look for a logical or lateral thinking solution\nConsidering the problem might not be about complex arithmetic but rather about the pattern or the presentation of the equation, let's think about what could logically fit. If we consider the equation as a play on symbols rather than strict arithmetic, we might look for a solution that fits the pattern in a more lateral or logical sense.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the equation as a representation of a concept rather than a strict mathematical operation\nGiven the format and the nature of the problem, it seems we are looking for a conceptual or lateral thinking solution rather than a straightforward arithmetic one. The equation might represent a balance or equilibrium, where the operations on both sides \"cancel out\" or balance each other.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$"
