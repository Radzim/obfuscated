  "solution": "## Problem Statement\nLet $\\omega$ be a complex number such that $\\omega^7 = 1$ and $\\omega \\ne 1.$  Compute\n\\[\\omega^{16} + \\omega^{18} + \\omega^{20} + \\dots + \\omega^{54}.\\]\n\nKey variables and constraints:\n- $\\omega$ is a complex number\n- $\\omega^7 = 1$\n- $\\omega \\ne 1$\n- We need to compute the sum of the series $\\omega^{16} + \\omega^{18} + \\omega^{20} + \\dots + \\omega^{54}$\n\n## Solution Strategy\nThe given series is a geometric series.\nFirst, we need to identify the first term, common ratio, and the number of terms in the series.\nThen we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\nWe will also use the property $\\omega^7 = 1$ to simplify the terms.\nThe formula for the sum of a geometric series is $S_n = \\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$, where $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms.\nWe also know that for $\\omega \\ne 1$ and $\\omega^7 = 1$, we have $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^4 + \\omega^5 + \\omega^6 = 0.$\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Identify the type of series:** The given series is $\\omega^{16} + \\omega^{18} + \\omega^{20} + \\dots + \\omega^{54}$.\n   The ratio of consecutive terms is constant: $\\frac{\\omega^{18}}{\\omega^{16}} = \\omega^{18-16} = \\omega^2$, $\\frac{\\omega^{20}}{\\omega^{18}} = \\omega^{20-18} = \\omega^2$, and so on.\n   Thus, this is a geometric series with common ratio $r = \\omega^2$.\n\n2. **Identify the first term:** The first term is $a = \\omega^{16}$.\n\n3. **Determine the number of terms:** The exponents form an arithmetic sequence $16, 18, 20, \\dots, 54$ with first term $16$ and common difference $2$.\n   Let $n$ be the number of terms. The $n$-th term is given by $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.\n   Here, $a_n = 54$, $a_1 = 16$, $d = 2$.\n   $54 = 16 + (n-1)2$\n   $54 - 16 = (n-1)2$\n   $38 = (n-1)2$\n   $19 = n-1$\n   $n = 20$.\n   There are $20$ terms in the series.\n\n4. **Apply the formula for the sum of a geometric series:**\n   $S_{20} = \\frac{a(1-r^{20})}{1-r} = \\frac{\\omega^{16}(1-(\\omega^2)^{20})}{1-\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\omega^{16}(1-\\omega^{40})}{1-\\omega^2}$.\n\n5. **Simplify the exponents using $\\omega^7 = 1$:**\n   $\\omega^{16} = \\omega^{2 \\cdot 7 + 2} = (\\omega^7)^2 \\cdot \\omega^2 = 1^2 \\cdot \\omega^2 = \\omega^2$.\n   $\\omega^{40} = \\omega^{5 \\cdot 7 + 5} = (\\omega^7)^5 \\cdot \\omega^5 = 1^5 \\cdot \\omega^5 = \\omega^5$.\n\n6. **Substitute the simplified terms back into the sum formula:**\n   $S_{20} = \\frac{\\omega^2(1-\\omega^5)}{1-\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\omega^2 - \\omega^2 \\cdot \\omega^5}{1-\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\omega^2 - \\omega^7}{1-\\omega^2}$.\n\n7. **Use $\\omega^7 = 1$ to further simplify:**\n   $S_{20} = \\frac{\\omega^2 - 1}{1-\\omega^2} = \\frac{- (1 - \\omega^2)}{1-\\omega^2}$.\n\n8. **Cancel out the common factor $(1-\\omega^2)$, provided $1-\\omega^2 \\ne 0$:**\n   Since $\\omega^7 = 1$ and $\\omega \\ne 1$, $\\omega$ is a 7th root of unity other than 1.\n   If $1 - \\omega^2 = 0$, then $\\omega^2 = 1$, which means $\\omega = \\pm 1$.\n   Since $\\omega \\ne 1$, we need to check if $\\omega = -1$ is possible. If $\\omega = -1$, then $\\omega^7 = (-1)^7 = -1 \\ne 1$, which contradicts $\\omega^7 = 1$.\n   Therefore, $\\omega \\ne -1$, and $\\omega^2 \\ne 1$, so $1 - \\omega^2 \\ne 0$.\n   We can cancel out $(1-\\omega^2)$:\n   $S_{20} = \\frac{- (1 - \\omega^2)}{1-\\omega^2} = -1$.\n\n## Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{-1}$",

But, we can observe that for the equation to hold true for any $\\omega$, $x$ must be such that the equation balances out.\n\n## Step 6: Consider special values of x\nOne special value of $x$ that could satisfy this equation, regardless of the specifics of $\\omega$ or the number of terms, is $x = 0$, because $0$ raised to any power is $0$, making the equation $0 = 0 + 0 + ... + 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Consider another special value\nAnother potential solution could be $x = 1$, because $1$ raised to any power is $1$. However, substituting $x = 1$ into the simplified equation yields $0 = 1^{18} + 1 + ... + 1$, which does not hold true unless the number of $1$'s being added is $0$, which contradicts the premise.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the solution\nGiven the information and the process of elimination, $x = 0$ seems like a viable solution because it satisfies the condition regardless of the specifics of the powers or the number of terms.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$"

This can be expressed as $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^4 + \\omega^5 + \\omega^6 = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Factor out omega from the sum of powers of omega\nWe can factor out an omega from the sum $ \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^4 + \\omega^5 + \\omega^6 $ to get $ \\omega (1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^4 + \\omega^5) $.\n\n## Step 4: Notice the sum of powers of omega from 1 to 6 is -1\nFrom step 2, we know $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^4 + \\omega^5 + \\omega^6 = 0$. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $ \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^4 + \\omega^5 + \\omega^6 = -1 $.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of powers of omega from 16 to 54\nNotice that $ \\omega^{16} = \\omega^7 \\cdot \\omega^7 \\cdot \\omega^2 = \\omega^2 $ because $ \\omega^7 = 1 $. Similarly, $ \\omega^{18} = \\omega^4 $, and so on, until $ \\omega^{54} = \\omega^5 $, because the powers of omega repeat every 7 powers.\n\n## Step 6: List the powers of omega from 16 to 54\nThe sequence of powers of omega from 16 to 54 is $ \\omega^2, \\omega^4, \\omega^6, \\omega^1, \\omega^3, \\omega^5 $.\n\n## Step 7: Sum the sequence of powers of omega from 16 to 54\nThe sum $ \\omega^{16} + \\omega^{18} + \\dots + \\omega^{54} $ simplifies to $ \\omega^2 + \\omega^4 + \\omega^6 + \\omega^1 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^5 $.\n\n## Step 8: Use the result from step 4 to simplify the sum\nFrom step 4, we know $ \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^4 + \\omega^5 + \\omega^6 = -1 $. The sum $ \\omega^2 + \\omega^4 + \\omega^6 + \\omega^1 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^5 $ is the same as $ \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^4 + \\omega^5 + \\omega^6 $, which equals -1.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-1}$"

The equation provided is incomplete, but we can infer that we're dealing with a series involving powers of $\\omega$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall properties of omega ($\\omega$)\n$\\omega$ is a complex cube root of unity, defined as $\\omega = -\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ or $\\omega = e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$. A key property of $\\omega$ is that $\\omega^3 = 1$ and $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the given series\nGiven the series $[\\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 + \\cdots + \\omega^{54}]$, we notice that $\\omega^3 = 1$ due to the properties of $\\omega$. This means the series can be simplified by considering the powers of $\\omega$ modulo 3, as the powers of $\\omega$ repeat every three terms.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the series\nSince $\\omega^3 = 1$, the series can be seen as a repetition of $\\omega$, $\\omega^2$, and $1$. The series up to $\\omega^{54}$ will have 18 complete sets of $\\omega$, $\\omega^2$, and $1$ because $54 \\div 3 = 18$. Each set sums to $0$ since $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum\nGiven that each set of three consecutive powers of $\\omega$ sums to $0$, and we have 18 complete sets, the sum of the series up to $\\omega^{54}$ is $0$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$"
