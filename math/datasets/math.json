Problem Statement**\nFind the smallest possible value of $|z + i|$ for a complex number $z$ satisfying $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|.$\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\nWe simplify the equation $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|$ by substituting $z = x + yi$ and converting it into a real equation in $x$ and $y$. We then express $|z + i|$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ and minimize it under the derived constraint.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\nLet $z = x + yi$. The given condition is $|z^2 + 4| = |z(z + 2i)|$.\nSquaring both sides, we get $|z^2 + 4|^2 = |z|^2 |z + 2i|^2$.\nSubstituting $z = x + yi$, we have:\n$(x^2 - y^2 + 4)^2 + (2xy)^2 = (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + (y+2)^2)$.\nExpanding and simplifying this equation, we arrive at:\n$x^2(1 - y) = (y - 1)(y + 2)^2$.\nIf $y \\neq 1$, we have $x^2 = -(y + 2)^2$. Since $x^2 \\ge 0$ and $-(y+2)^2 \\le 0$, we must have $x^2 = 0$ and $-(y+2)^2 = 0$. This gives $x = 0$ and $y = -2$. Thus $z = -2i$.\nIf $y = 1$, the equation $x^2(1 - y) = (y - 1)(y + 2)^2$ becomes $0 = 0$, which holds for any $x$. In this case, $z = x + i$.\nWe want to minimize $|z + i|$.\nFor $z = -2i$, $|z + i| = |-2i + i| = |-i| = 1$.\nFor $z = x + i$, $|z + i| = |x + i + i| = |x + 2i| = \\sqrt{x^2 + 4}$. The minimum value is when $x = 0$, and the minimum value is $\\sqrt{0^2 + 4} = 2$.\nComparing the two minimum values $1$ and $2$, the smallest possible value of $|z + i|$ is $1$.\n\n**4.

    "solution": "## Problem Solution\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nCompute the square root of the expression formed by the product of four consecutive integers starting from 28, plus one.\nIn mathematical terms, evaluate $\\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1}$.\n\nKey variables:\n- We are asked to compute the square root of an expression.\n- The expression is formed by the product of four consecutive integers: 28, 29, 30, and 31, plus 1.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will try to find a pattern by considering similar expressions with smaller consecutive integers. We hypothesize that the expression inside the square root is a perfect square. We will then generalize the pattern algebraically to derive a formula for the square root of the product of four consecutive integers plus one. Finally, we will apply this formula to the given problem.\n\nRelevant formulas/theorems:\n- Algebraic manipulation\n- Recognizing perfect square trinomials, i.e., $(a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nLet's denote the expression inside the square root as $E = (31)(30)(29)(28)+1$.\nWe can rearrange the terms to identify a pattern:\n$E = (31 \\times 28) \\times (30 \\times 29) + 1$\n$E = (30+1)(30-2) \\times (30)(30-1) + 1$\n$E = (30^2 - 2 \\times 30 + 30 - 2) \\times (30^2 - 30) + 1$\n$E = (30^2 - 30 - 2) \\times (30^2 - 30) + 1$\n\nLet $x = 30^2 - 30$. Then $E = (x-2)x + 1 = x^2 - 2x + 1$.\nWe recognize that $x^2 - 2x + 1$ is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as $(x-1)^2$.\nSo, $E = (x-1)^2 = (30^2 - 30 - 1)^2$.\nNow we substitute back $x = 30^2 - 30 = 900 - 30 = 870$.\n$E = (870 - 1)^2 = (869)^2$.\n\nTherefore, $\\sqrt{E} = \\sqrt{(869)^2} = |869|$.\nSince 869 is positive, $\\sqrt{E} = 869$.\n\nAlternatively, let's generalize for four consecutive integers $n, n+1, n+2, n+3$.\nConsider the product $P = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$.\nRearrange the terms: $P = [n(n+3)][(n+1)(n+2)] = (n^2+3n)(n^2+3n+2)$.\nLet $y = n^2+3n$. Then $P = y(y+2) = y^2+2y$.\nSo $P+1 = y^2+2y+1 = (y+1)^2 = (n^2+3n+1)^2$.\nThus, $\\sqrt{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)+1} = \\sqrt{(n^2+3n+1)^2} = |n^2+3n+1|$.\nIn our problem, the four consecutive integers are $28, 29, 30, 31$. Let $n=28$.\nThen $n^2+3n+1 = 28^2 + 3(28) + 1 = 784 + 84 + 1 = 869$.\n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n$28^2 = 784$\n$3 \\times 28 = 84$\n$784 + 84 + 1 = 869$\n\nWe can also use the middle numbers approach.\nLet the integers be $n-1, n, n+1, n+2$. Let $n=29$.\nThen the integers are $28, 29, 30, 31$.\n$(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)+1 = [n(n+1)][(n-1)(n+2)]+1 = (n^2+n)(n^2+n-2)+1$.\nLet $z = n^2+n$. Then $(z)(z-2)+1 = z^2-2z+1 = (z-1)^2 = (n^2+n-1)^2$.\nFor $n=29$, $n^2+n-1 = 29^2+29-1 = 841+29-1 = 841+28 = 869$.\n\nFinal verification:\n$869^2 = 755161$.\n$(31)(30)(29)(28)+1 = 31 \\times 30 \\times 29 \\times 28 + 1 = 930 \\times 29 \\times 28 + 1 = 26970 \\times 28 + 1 = 755160 + 1 = 755161$.\nThus, $\\sqrt{(31)(30)(29)(28)+1} = \\sqrt{755161} = 869$.\n\n**4.

Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1:** Identify the second root using the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem.\nSince the polynomial has real coefficients and $3 + i$ is a root, its complex conjugate $3 - i$ must also be a root.\nThus, the two roots are $r_1 = 3 + i$ and $r_2 = 3 - i$.\n\n**Step 2:** Use the roots and the leading coefficient to form the quadratic polynomial.\nThe quadratic polynomial can be written as $P(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$.\nWe are given $a = 2$, $r_1 = 3 + i$, and $r_2 = 3 - i$.\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n$P(x) = 2(x - (3 + i))(x - (3 - i))$\n\n**Step 3:** Expand and simplify the expression for $P(x)$.\n$P(x) = 2((x - 3) - i)((x - 3) + i)$\nThis is in the form of $(A - B)(A + B) = A^2 - B^2$, where $A = (x - 3)$ and $B = i$.\n$P(x) = 2((x - 3)^2 - (i)^2)$\nWe know that $i^2 = -1$, so:\n$P(x) = 2((x - 3)^2 - (-1))$\n$P(x) = 2((x - 3)^2 + 1)$\nExpand $(x - 3)^2$:\n$(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 2(3)x + 3^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9$\nSubstitute this back into the expression for $P(x)$:\n$P(x) = 2((x^2 - 6x + 9) + 1)$\n$P(x) = 2(x^2 - 6x + 10)$\nDistribute the 2:\n$P(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 20$\n\n**Step 4:** Verify the conditions.\n- The coefficient of $x^2$ is 2, which is given.\n- The coefficients are $2, -12, 20$, which are all real numbers.\n- Let's check if $3 + i$ is a root of $P(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 20$.\n$P(3 + i) = 2(3 + i)^2 - 12(3 + i) + 20$\n$P(3 + i) = 2(9 + 6i + i^2) - 36 - 12i + 20$\n$P(3 + i) = 2(9 + 6i - 1) - 36 - 12i + 20$\n$P(3 + i) = 2(8 + 6i) - 36 - 12i + 20$\n$P(3 + i) = 16 + 12i - 36 - 12i + 20$\n$P(3 + i) = (16 - 36 + 20) + (12i - 12i)$\n$P(3 + i) = 0 + 0i = 0$\nSo, $3 + i$ is indeed a root.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe quadratic polynomial is $\\boxed{2x^2 - 12x + 20}$.\n\n**Verification:**\n- The polynomial is quadratic.\n- The coefficients $2, -12, 20$ are real numbers.\n- The coefficient of $x^2$ is 2.\n- $3 + i$ is a root (verified in Step 4).\n- The other root is $3 - i$. We can check this:\n$P(3 - i) = 2(3 - i)^2 - 12(3 - i) + 20$\n$P(3 - i) = 2(9 - 6i + i^2) - 36 + 12i + 20$\n$P(3 - i) = 2(9 - 6i - 1) - 36 + 12i + 20$\n$P(3 - i) = 2(8 - 6i) - 36 + 12i + 20$\n$P(3 - i) = 16 - 12i - 36 + 12i + 20$\n$P(3 - i) = (16 - 36 + 20) + (-12i + 12i)$\n$P(3 - i) = 0 + 0i = 0$\nSo, $3 - i$ is also a root.

A property derived from this equation is $f(nx) = n f(x)$ for any integer $n.$ We will use this property to relate $f(4)$ and $f(5)$ to $f(1),$ and then use the given value of $f(4)$ to find $f(1),$ and finally calculate $f(5).$\n\nAlternatively, we can assume a linear form for $f(x)$ based on Cauchy's functional equation (assuming continuity, though not strictly needed for this problem as we only need to find $f(5)$ based on $f(4)$). We assume $f(x) = cx$ and use the condition $f(4) = 5$ to find $c,$ and then calculate $f(5).$\n\nFormulas/theorems:\n- Property of Cauchy's functional equation: $f(nx) = n f(x)$ for integer $n.$\n- For rational $x,$ $f(x) = cx$ where $c = f(1).$\n\n### 3. **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1:** Use the property $f(nx) = n f(x)$ for integer $n.$\nLet $x = 1.$ Then $f(n) = f(n \\cdot 1) = n f(1)$ for any integer $n.$\nIn particular, for $n = 4,$ we have $f(4) = 4 f(1).$\n\n**Step 2:** Use the given value $f(4) = 5$ to find $f(1).$\nWe have $f(4) = 4 f(1) = 5.$\nDividing both sides by 4, we get $f(1) = \\frac{5}{4}.$\n\n**Step 3:** Use the property $f(n) = n f(1)$ for integer $n$ to find $f(5).$\nFor $n = 5,$ we have $f(5) = 5 f(1).$\nSubstitute the value of $f(1) = \\frac{5}{4}$ into the expression for $f(5).$\n$f(5) = 5 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{25}{4}.$\n\n**Alternatively, using the linear form:**\nAssume $f(x) = cx.$\nSubstitute this into the functional equation:\n$f(x+y) = c(x+y) = cx + cy = f(x) + f(y).$\nSo $f(x) = cx$ is a solution.\nUse the condition $f(4) = 5.$\n$f(4) = c \\times 4 = 5.$\n$c = \\frac{5}{4}.$\nThus $f(x) = \\frac{5}{4} x.$\nNow find $f(5).$\n$f(5) = \\frac{5}{4} \\times 5 = \\frac{25}{4}.$\n\n**Verification:**\nCheck if $f(x) = \\frac{25}{4} x$ satisfies $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ and $f(4) = 5.$\n$f(x + y) = \\frac{5}{4} (x + y) = \\frac{5}{4} x + \\frac{5}{4} y = f(x) + f(y).$  (Correct)\n$f(4) = \\frac{5}{4} \\times 4 = 5.$ (Correct)\nSo the conditions are satisfied.\n\n### 4. **Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{4}}$",

    "problem": "What is the remainder when $x^2+7x-5$ divides $2x^4+11x^3-42x^2-60x+47$?",
    "solution": "## Solution:\n\n**1. Problem Statement**\n\nWe are asked to find the remainder when the polynomial $P(x) = 2x^4+11x^3-42x^2-60x+47$ is divided by the polynomial $D(x) = x^2+7x-5$.\nLet $P(x)$ be the dividend and $D(x)$ be the divisor. We need to find the remainder $R(x)$ in the division $P(x) \\div D(x)$.\nThe degree of $P(x)$ is 4 and the degree of $D(x)$ is 2.\nThe degree of the remainder $R(x)$ must be less than the degree of the divisor $D(x)$. Thus, the degree of $R(x)$ is at most 1. We can express the remainder in the form $R(x) = ax+b$.\n\n**2. Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use polynomial long division to find the quotient and the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $D(x)$.\nThe process involves repeatedly dividing the leading term of the current dividend by the leading term of the divisor, multiplying the result by the divisor, and subtracting it from the current dividend. We continue this process until the degree of the remaining polynomial is less than the degree of the divisor.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nWe perform polynomial long division:\n```\n        2x^2  -3x   -11\n      ___________________\nx^2+7x-5 | 2x^4 +11x^3 -42x^2 -60x  +47\n        -(2x^4 +14x^3 -10x^2)\n        ___________________\n              -3x^3 -32x^2 -60x\n             -(-3x^3 -21x^2 +15x)\n             ___________________\n                    -11x^2 -75x  +47\n                   -(-11x^2 -77x  +55)\n                   ___________________\n                           2x   -8\n```\n\n**Step 1:** Divide $2x^4$ by $x^2$ to get $2x^2$. Multiply $2x^2$ by $x^2+7x-5$ to get $2x^4+14x^3-10x^2$. Subtract this from the dividend:\n$(2x^4+11x^3-42x^2-60x+47) - (2x^4+14x^3-10x^2) = -3x^3-32x^2-60x+47$.\n\n**Step 2:** Divide $-3x^3$ by $x^2$ to get $-3x$. Multiply $-3x$ by $x^2+7x-5$ to get $-3x^3-21x^2+15x$. Subtract this from the result of Step 1:\n$(-3x^3-32x^2-60x+47) - (-3x^3-21x^2+15x) = -11x^2-75x+47$.\n\n**Step 3:** Divide $-11x^2$ by $x^2$ to get $-11$. Multiply $-11$ by $x^2+7x-5$ to get $-11x^2-77x+55$. Subtract this from the result of Step 2:\n$(-11x^2-75x+47) - (-11x^2-77x+55) = 2x-8$.\n\nThe degree of $2x-8$ is 1, which is less than the degree of $x^2+7x-5$. Thus, the remainder is $R(x) = 2x-8$.\nThe quotient is $Q(x) = 2x^2-3x-11$.\n\nWe can verify this by checking if $P(x) = Q(x)D(x) + R(x)$:\n$(2x^2-3x-11)(x^2+7x-5) + (2x-8)$\n$= 2x^2(x^2+7x-5) -3x(x^2+7x-5) -11(x^2+7x-5) + (2x-8)$\n$= (2x^4+14x^3-10x^2) + (-3x^3-21x^2+15x) + (-11x^2-77x+55) + (2x-8)$\n$= 2x^4 + (14x^3-3x^3) + (-10x^2-21x^2-11x^2) + (15x-77x+2x) + (55-8)$\n$= 2x^4 + 11x^3 - 42x^2 - 60x + 47$\nThis matches the original polynomial $P(x)$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe remainder when $x^2+7x-5$ divides $2x^4+11x^3-42x^2-60x+47$ is $2x-8$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2x-8}$",

For instance, if $x=1$, $2|1| = 2$ and $3^{1^2-3} = 3^{-2} = 1/9$. $2 \\neq 1/9$.\n\n   Therefore, the function is even.\n\n4. **Final Answer**\n   The function $f(x) = 3^{x^2-3} - |x|$ is an even function.\n\n   Final Answer: \\boxed{even}",

    "solution": "## Problem Statement\nThe problem asks us to identify the graph of the function $y = f(x+2)$, given the graph of $y = f(x)$. We are provided with the definition of $f(x)$ piecewise and its graph, and we need to choose from five options (A, B, C, D, E) which graph represents $y = f(x+2)$.\n\n### Key Variables and Constraints\n- We are given the function $f(x)$ graphically and piecewise.\n- We need to find the graph of $y = f(x+2)$.\n- We need to select the correct graph from options A, B, C, D, E.\n\n## Solution Strategy\nThe transformation from $y = f(x)$ to $y = f(x+2)$ is a horizontal shift. Replacing $x$ with $x+c$ in $f(x)$ shifts the graph horizontally by $|c|$ units. If $c > 0$, the shift is to the left, and if $c < 0$, the shift is to the right. In our case, we have $x+2$, so $c = 2 > 0$, which means the graph will be shifted to the left by 2 units.\n\nWe can analyze key points on the graph of $y = f(x)$ and apply the horizontal shift to find the corresponding points on the graph of $y = f(x+2)$.\nFrom the definition of $f(x)$ provided in the code, we have the following pieces:\n1. For $-3 \\le x \\le 0$, $y = -2 - x$.\n2. For $0 \\le x \\le 2$, $y = \\sqrt{4 - (x - 2)^2} - 2$.\n3. For $2 \\le x \\le 3$, $y = 2(x - 2)$.\n\nLet's find key points on the graph of $y = f(x)$:\n- At $x = -3$, $y = -2 - (-3) = 1$. Point $(-3, 1)$.\n- At $x = 0$, $y = -2 - 0 = -2$. Point $(0, -2)$.\n- At $x = 2$, $y = \\sqrt{4 - (2 - 2)^2} - 2 = \\sqrt{4} - 2 = 0$. Point $(2, 0)$.\n- At $x = 3$, $y = 2(3 - 2) = 2$. Point $(3, 2)$.\n\nFor $y = f(x+2)$, we shift each x-coordinate to the left by 2 units while keeping the y-coordinate the same.\n- For $(-3, 1)$ on $y = f(x)$, the corresponding point on $y = f(x+2)$ is $(-3 - 2, 1) = (-5, 1)$.\n- For $(0, -2)$ on $y = f(x)$, the corresponding point on $y = f(x+2)$ is $(0 - 2, -2) = (-2, -2)$.\n- For $(2, 0)$ on $y = f(x)$, the corresponding point on $y = f(x+2)$ is $(2 - 2, 0) = (0, 0)$.\n- For $(3, 2)$ on $y = f(x)$, the corresponding point on $y = f(x+2)$ is $(3 - 2, 2) = (1, 2)$.\n\nNow let's check which graph among the options passes through the points $(-5, 1), (-2, -2), (0, 0), (1, 2)$. By visually inspecting the graphs provided, graph E appears to pass through these points. Graph E is generated by the code `draw(graf[5],graph(funce,-5,1),red);` where `funce(real x) { return(func(x + 2)); }`. This confirms that graph E is indeed the graph of $y = f(x+2)$.\n\nLet's also check the transformations applied in other options:\n- Graph A: `shift((2,-1))*graph(func,-3,3)` - Shift right by 2 and down by 1.\n- Graph B: `shift((2,1))*graph(func,-3,3)` - Shift right by 2 and up by 1.\n- Graph C: `graph(funcc,-1,5)` where `funcc(real x) { return(func(x - 2)); }` - Graph of $y = f(x-2)$, shift right by 2.\n- Graph D: `shift((-2,-1))*graph(func,-3,3)` - Shift left by 2 and down by 1.\n- Graph E: `graph(funce,-5,1)` where `funce(real x) { return(func(x + 2)); }` - Graph of $y = f(x+2)$, shift left by 2.\n\nBased on our analysis, graph E is the graph of $y = f(x+2)$.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Understand the transformation:** The function $y = f(x+2)$ represents a horizontal shift of the graph of $y = f(x)$.\n2. **Determine the direction and magnitude of the shift:** Since we are replacing $x$ with $x+2$, the shift is to the left by 2 units.\n3. **Identify key points on the graph of $y = f(x)$:**  We found the points $(-3, 1), (0, -2), (2, 0), (3, 2)$.\n4. **Apply the horizontal shift to the key points:** Shift each x-coordinate to the left by 2 units:\n    - $(-3, 1) \\rightarrow (-3 - 2, 1) = (-5, 1)$\n    - $(0, -2) \\rightarrow (0 - 2, -2) = (-2, -2)$\n    - $(2, 0) \\rightarrow (2 - 2, 0) = (0, 0)$\n    - $(3, 2) \\rightarrow (3 - 2, 2) = (1, 2)$\n5. **Compare the shifted points with the provided graphs:** Graph E visually matches the shifted points and the expected shape of the transformed function.\n6. **Verify with the code:** The code for graph E explicitly defines it as the graph of $y = f(x+2)$.\n\n## Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{E}$",

Then $|B| = |1| = 1$ and $|C| = |-1| = 1$.\nIn this case, $B^2 - 4C = 1 - 4(-1) = 5.$\nThen $\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C} = \\sqrt{5}.$\nWe choose the minus sign to maximize $|B - \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = |1 - \\sqrt{5}| = \\sqrt{5} - 1.$\nWe choose the plus sign to maximize $|B + \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = |1 + \\sqrt{5}| = 1 + \\sqrt{5}.$\nThe larger value is $1 + \\sqrt{5}.$\nThen the maximum value of $|z| = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Divide by $a$**: Since $a \\neq 0,$ we divide the equation $az^2 + bz + c = 0$ by $a$ to get $z^2 + \\frac{b}{a}z + \\frac{c}{a} = 0.$\n2. **Substitute $B = b/a$ and $C = c/a$**: Let $B = \\frac{b}{a}$ and $C = \\frac{c}{a}.$ Then the equation becomes $z^2 + Bz + C = 0.$\n3. **Determine magnitudes of $B$ and $C$**: Since $|a| = |b| = |c| > 0,$ we have $|B| = |\\frac{b}{a}| = \\frac{|b|}{|a|} = 1$ and $|C| = |\\frac{c}{a}| = \\frac{|c|}{|a|} = 1.$\n4. **Apply the quadratic formula**: The solutions for $z$ are given by $z = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}}{2}.$\n5. **Maximize $|z|$**: We want to maximize $|z| = \\frac{|-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2} = \\frac{|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|}{2}.$ To maximize $|z|,$ we need to maximize $|B \\mp \\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|.$\n6. **Maximize $|\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}|$**: We have $|\\sqrt{B^2 - 4C}| = \\sqrt{|B^2 - 4C|}.$ By triangle inequality, $|B^2 - 4C| \\le |B^2| + |4C| = |B|^2 + 4|C| = 1^2 + 4(1) = 5.$ The maximum value of $|B^2 - 4C|$ is $5.$ This is achieved when $B^2$ and $-4C$ have the same argument.\n7. **Choose $B$ and $C$ to achieve maximum $|B^2 - 4C|$**: Let $B = 1,$ then $B^2 = 1.$ To make $-4C$ have the same argument as $B^2 = 1,$ we choose $-4C = 4,$ so $C = -1.$ Then $|B| = 1$ and $|C| = 1,$ which satisfy the conditions.\n8. **Calculate $z$ with chosen $B$ and $C$**: With $B = 1$ and $C = -1,$ $z = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(-1)}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n9. **Find the largest $|z|$**: We have two solutions $z_1 = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $z_2 = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n$|z_1| = |\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}| = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}.$\n$|z_2| = |\\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}| = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\nThe largest value is $|z_2| = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}$",

    "problem": "The ellipse $x^2+4y^2=4$ and the hyperbola $x^2-m(y+2)^2 = 1$ are tangent. Compute $m.$",
    "solution": "**Problem Statement**\n\nThe ellipse is given by the equation $x^2+4y^2=4$.\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation $x^2-m(y+2)^2 = 1$, where $m$ is a constant.\nWe are given that the ellipse and the hyperbola are tangent. We need to compute the value of $m$.\n\nKey variables:\n- Ellipse equation: $x^2+4y^2=4$\n- Hyperbola equation: $x^2-m(y+2)^2 = 1$\n- Tangency condition: Ellipse and hyperbola intersect at exactly one point and have the same tangent at that point.\n- Unknown variable: $m$\n\n**Solution Strategy**\n\nWe will use the condition for tangency by setting the discriminant of the quadratic equation obtained by substituting $x^2$ from the ellipse equation into the hyperbola equation to zero.\nAlternatively, we can use the condition that at the point of tangency, the slopes of the tangent lines to both curves are equal.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Method 1: Discriminant Method**\n1. Solve for $x^2$ from the ellipse equation: $x^2 = 4 - 4y^2$.\n2. Substitute this expression for $x^2$ into the hyperbola equation:\n   $(4 - 4y^2) - m(y+2)^2 = 1$\n3. Simplify the equation to obtain a quadratic equation in $y$:\n   $4 - 4y^2 - m(y^2 + 4y + 4) = 1$\n   $4 - 4y^2 - my^2 - 4my - 4m = 1$\n   $(-4-m)y^2 - 4my + (4-4m-1) = 0$\n   $(-4-m)y^2 - 4my + (3-4m) = 0$\n4. For tangency, the quadratic equation must have exactly one solution for $y$. This means the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant of a quadratic equation $ay^2+by+c=0$ is $D = b^2-4ac$. In our case, $a = -4-m$, $b = -4m$, $c = 3-4m$.\n   $D = (-4m)^2 - 4(-4-m)(3-4m) = 0$\n   $16m^2 - 4(-12 + 16m - 3m + 4m^2) = 0$\n   $16m^2 - 4(-12 + 13m + 4m^2) = 0$\n   $16m^2 + 48 - 52m - 16m^2 = 0$\n   $48 - 52m = 0$\n   $52m = 48$\n   $m = \\frac{48}{52} = \\frac{12}{13}$\n\n**Method 2: Equal Slopes Method**\n1. Find the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ for the ellipse $x^2+4y^2=4$ using implicit differentiation:\n   $2x + 8y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$\n   $\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{2x}{8y} = -\\frac{x}{4y}$\n2. Find the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ for the hyperbola $x^2-m(y+2)^2 = 1$ using implicit differentiation:\n   $2x - 2m(y+2) \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$\n   $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{2x}{2m(y+2)} = \\frac{x}{m(y+2)}$\n3. Equate the slopes:\n   $-\\frac{x}{4y} = \\frac{x}{m(y+2)}$\n   Assuming $x \\neq 0$ at the point of tangency, we can cancel $x$ from both sides:\n   $-\\frac{1}{4y} = \\frac{1}{m(y+2)}$\n   $-m(y+2) = 4y$\n   $-my - 2m = 4y$\n   $-2m = 4y + my$\n   $-2m = y(4+m)$\n   $y = -\\frac{2m}{m+4}$\n4. Substitute $y = -\\frac{2m}{m+4}$ into the ellipse equation $x^2 = 4-4y^2$:\n   $x^2 = 4 - 4(-\\frac{2m}{m+4})^2 = 4 - 4\\frac{4m^2}{(m+4)^2} = 4(1 - \\frac{4m^2}{(m+4)^2}) = 4\\frac{(m+4)^2 - 4m^2}{(m+4)^2} = 4\\frac{m^2+8m+16-4m^2}{(m+4)^2} = 4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2}$\n5. Substitute $y = -\\frac{2m}{m+4}$ and $x^2 = 4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2}$ into the hyperbola equation $x^2-m(y+2)^2 = 1$:\n   $4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2} - m(-\\frac{2m}{m+4}+2)^2 = 1$\n   $4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2} - m(\\frac{-2m+2(m+4)}{m+4})^2 = 1$\n   $4\\frac{-3m^2+8m+16}{(m+4)^2} - m(\\frac{8}{m+4})^2 = 1$\n   $4(-3m^2+8m+16) - 64m = (m+4)^2$\n   $-12m^2+32m+64 - 64m = m^2+8m+16$\n   $0 = 13m^2 + 40m - 48$\n   $m = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{40^2 - 4(13)(-48)}}{26} = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{1600 + 2496}}{26} = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{4096}}{26} = \\frac{-40 \\pm 64}{26}$\n   $m = \\frac{24}{26} = \\frac{12}{13}$ or $m = \\frac{-104}{26} = -4$. Since $m$ is likely to be positive for a hyperbola of this form, we take $m = \\frac{12}{13}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result $m = \\frac{12}{13}$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{12}{13}}$",
