Return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence that can be obtained after at most k operations.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n```\nInput: s = \"abcdeca\", k = 2\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: Replace 'b' and 'e' with 'a' to make the string \"aaaaaaa\", which is a palindrome.\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n```\nInput: s = \"abcdef\", k = 1\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: No matter how you modify the string, you cannot get a palindrome longer than 1.\n```\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n- 1 <= s.length <= 100\n- s consists of lowercase English letters.\n- 0 <= k <= s.length",
