  "question": "You are given two arrays of integers, fruits and baskets, each of length n, where fruits[i] represents the quantity of the ith type of fruit, and baskets[j] represents the capacity of the jth basket. From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:\n\n- Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or equal to the quantity of that fruit type.\n- Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.\n- If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.\n\nReturn the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n```\nInput: fruits = [4,2,5], baskets = [3,5,4]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nfruits[0] = 4 is placed in baskets[1] = 5.\nfruits[1] = 2 is placed in baskets[0] = 3.\nfruits[2] = 5 cannot be placed in baskets[2] = 4.\nSince one fruit type remains unplaced, we return 1.\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n```\nInput: fruits = [3,6,1], baskets = [6,4,7]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nfruits[0] = 3 is placed in baskets[0] = 6.\nfruits[1] = 6 cannot be placed in baskets[1] = 4 (insufficient capacity) but can be placed in the next available basket, baskets[2] = 7.\nfruits[2] = 1 is placed in baskets[1] = 4.\nSince all fruits are successfully placed, we return 0.\n```\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n- n == fruits.length == baskets.length\n- 1 <= n <= 10^5\n- 1 <= fruits[i], baskets[i] <= 10^9",
