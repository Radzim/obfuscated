The minimum number of nodes across all longest special paths is 3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]\nOutput: [0, 0]\nExplanation: There is no special path since all values appear more than twice.\n\nConstraints:\n- 1 <= n <= 10^5\n- 1 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10^4\n- edges.length == n - 1\n- 0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] < n",
