  "question": "Given two strings, str1 and str2, each consisting of lowercase English letters, your task is to generate the lexicographically smallest string possible by interleaving the characters of str1 and str2. You can pick characters from either string in any order, but you must use all characters from both strings exactly once.\n\nReturn the lexicographically smallest string that can be generated by interleaving str1 and str2. If no such string can be generated, return an empty string.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n```\nInput: str1 = \"ac\", str2 = \"bd\"\nOutput: \"abcd\"\nExplanation: One possible way to generate the string is by picking 'a' from str1, then 'b' from str2, then 'c' from str1, and finally 'd' from str2.\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n```\nInput: str1 = \"ab\", str2 = \"pqrs\"\nOutput: \"abpqrs\"\nExplanation: Since str1 is already lexicographically smaller than str2, we can simply concatenate them.\n```\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n- 1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 100\n- str1 and str2 consist of lowercase English letters.",
