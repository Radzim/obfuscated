  "question": "You are given an array of strings words and an integer k. For each index i in the range [0, words.length - 1], find the length of the longest common prefix among any k strings (selected at distinct indices) from the remaining array after removing the ith element. Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the answer for the ith element. If removing the ith element leaves fewer than k strings, the answer should be 0.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n```\nInput: words = [\"apple\", \"apricot\", \"ape\", \"apartment\"], k = 2\nOutput: [2, 2, 2, 2]\nExplanation:\n- Removing \"apple\", the longest common prefix among any 2 strings is \"ap\" with length 2.\n- Removing \"apricot\", the longest common prefix among any 2 strings is \"ap\" with length 2.\n- Removing \"ape\", the longest common prefix among any 2 strings is \"ap\" with length 2.\n- Removing \"apartment\", the longest common prefix among any 2 strings is \"ap\" with length 2.\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n```\nInput: words = [\"dog\", \"racecar\", \"car\"], k = 2\nOutput: [0, 0, 0]\nExplanation:\n- Removing any word leaves fewer than 2 strings, so the answer for each is 0.\n```\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n- 2 <= words.length <= 100\n- 1 <= words[i].length <= 100\n- words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.\n- 2 <= k <= words.length",
