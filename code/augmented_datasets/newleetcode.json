Additionally, you are given a 2D array conflictingPairs, where conflictingPairs[i] = [a, b] indicates that a and b form a conflicting pair. Remove exactly one element from conflictingPairs. Afterward, count the number of non-empty subarrays of nums which do not contain both a and b for any remaining conflicting pair [a, b]. Return the maximum number of subarrays possible after removing exactly one conflicting pair.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 4, conflictingPairs = [[2,3],[1,4]]\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: Remove [2, 3] from conflictingPairs. Now, conflictingPairs = [[1, 4]]. There are 9 subarrays in nums where [1, 4] do not appear together. They are [1], [2], [3], [4], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 2, 3] and [2, 3, 4].

Your task is to remove all elements from the array by performing one of the following operations at each step until nums is empty:\n\n- Choose any two elements from the first three elements of nums and remove them. The cost of this operation is the maximum of the two elements removed.\n- If fewer than three elements remain in nums, remove all the remaining elements in a single operation. The cost of this operation is the maximum of the remaining elements.\n\nReturn the minimum cost required to remove all the elements.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n```\nInput: nums = [6,2,8,4]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation:\nInitially, nums = [6, 2, 8, 4].\n\n- In the first operation, remove nums[0] = 6 and nums[2] = 8 with a cost of max(6, 8) = 8. Now, nums = [2, 4].\n- In the second operation, remove the remaining elements with a cost of max(2, 4) = 4.\n\nThe cost to remove all elements is 8 + 4 = 12. This is the minimum cost to remove all elements in nums. Hence, the output is 12.\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n```\nInput: nums = [2,1,3,3]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation:\nInitially, nums = [2, 1, 3, 3].\n\n- In the first operation, remove nums[0] = 2 and nums[1] = 1 with a cost of max(2, 1) = 2. Now, nums = [3, 3].\n- In the second operation, remove the remaining elements with a cost of max(3, 3) = 3.\n\nThe cost to remove all elements is 2 + 3 = 5. This is the minimum cost to remove all elements in nums. Hence, the output is 5.\n```\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000\n- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6",
