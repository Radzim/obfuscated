*Comparison*
- Leetcode (New vs Old, 20 questions each, 0.1 steps augmentation over 4 models, 1 call each, code evaluation)
- QUESTIONS: Leetcode New, Leetcode Old, OTHER?
- AUGMENTATIONS: Keyboard, Synonym, Remove
- LLM ANSWERS
- EVALUATION
- Another Coding Dataset?

quick comparison via hard-medium-easy

Add a human benchmark - 100 task-person-aug samples, say if you would be able to solve this. Or like below.

Adversarial Examples
- Slightly changed questions so that they logically are different
- Better performance on new dataset (?)


Demonstration
- Show that this is present for other types of questions too, such as math and logic.
- Comparison against human benchmark 
  - (4 people shown task, less and less obfuscated, asked at which point they know what the question is about)
  -
